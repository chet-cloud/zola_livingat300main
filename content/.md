excerpt: |-
  At a certain age, we all crave more independence to express ourselves and make our own choices. At that point, you have a choice: to get yourself out into the world and find independence, or stay in the comfort of the childhood nest and convince yourself that independence can coexist with mama’s dinners.  

  You might have to give up mama’s meals, but standing on your own two feet is easier to learn when you push yourself out of your comfort zone. Here are three reasons why I think it’s important and healthy for young people to move out of their parents’ home and start living on their own.

<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Reason 1: </span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">Show your family—and yourself—that you’re ready to be more mature </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"> </span></h3>
<span data-contrast="auto">Whether you’re moving out for freedom, room to grow, or just a more convenient location, living on your own requires some life skills and emotional maturity. Living on your own, you learn to rely on yourself to overcome challenges. You’ll learn how </span><span data-contrast="auto">to manage finances, space, time, and, most importantly, how to deal with unpleasant situations.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> These are some of the</span><span data-contrast="auto"> best teachers out there to teach</span><span data-contrast="auto"> a young person maturity and independence</span><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">When I moved out for college, the first few days were full of delightful hours of organizing my place and thinking about all the fun I could have living on my own. Then came the realization that it wasn’t all going to be fun, and I had a lot of new things to learn: n</span><span data-contrast="auto">ew lessons </span><span data-contrast="auto">that </span><span data-contrast="auto">I am grateful for</span><span data-contrast="auto">, but</span><span data-contrast="auto"> were not what I expected. </span><span data-contrast="auto">I can’t count how many times I thought about giving it all up and moving back in with my parents. </span><span data-contrast="auto">However, times of </span><span data-contrast="auto">instability turned</span><span data-contrast="auto"> me into a </span><span data-contrast="auto">more</span><span data-contrast="auto"> mature person and allowed me </span><span data-contrast="auto">to see myself in a new light, which wouldn’t have happened in </span><span data-contrast="auto">the com</span><span data-contrast="auto">fort of my parents' house</span><span data-contrast="auto">.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"> </span>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Reason 2: </span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">Give yourself the freedom you need to grow </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"> </span></h3>
<span data-contrast="auto">Eventually, we all need more </span><span data-contrast="auto">privacy</span><span data-contrast="auto"> and freedom of choice than we can usually find living with our parents.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> No matter how l</span><span data-contrast="auto">oving </span><span data-contrast="auto">and understanding your </span><span data-contrast="auto">parents are</span><span data-contrast="auto">,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> one day </span><span data-contrast="auto">a bedroom starts feeling too tight</span><span data-contrast="auto"> and you start to crave a bigger, more private space.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> It</span><span data-contrast="auto">’s </span><span data-contrast="auto">not </span><span data-contrast="auto">just </span><span data-contrast="auto">about the square footage; </span><span data-contrast="auto">it’s </span><span data-contrast="auto">about the ability to </span><span data-contrast="auto">cook</span><span data-contrast="auto"> and watch</span><span data-contrast="auto"> whatever </span><span data-contrast="auto">you want,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> and to invite </span><span data-contrast="auto">over </span><span data-contrast="auto">whoever</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">you want, whenever you want. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">Even though I had to learn some harsh lessons along the way,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> living on my own expanded my creative ideas in terms of interior design, and my social skills when it came to hosting my parties. After years of living and studying under my parent</span><span data-contrast="auto">s’ </span><span data-contrast="auto">intent</span><span data-contrast="auto"> gaze</span><span data-contrast="auto">, moving out allowed me to live as I wanted without interrupting the plans of others. </span><span data-contrast="auto">I had the space I needed to find my self—and to have yogurt for dinner if I wanted. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"> </span>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Reason 3: </span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">Learn responsibility </span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"> </span></h3>
<span data-contrast="auto">L</span><span data-contrast="auto">iving on your own teaches responsibility like nothing else</span><span data-contrast="auto">!</span><span data-contrast="auto"> Parents tend to see</span><span data-contrast="auto"> their children as little kids </span><span data-contrast="auto">who require constant protection</span><span data-contrast="auto">,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> no matter what age they already are</span><span data-contrast="auto">. They just can’t help but </span><span data-contrast="auto">protect and take as much care as they can to provide a comfortable and carefree</span><span data-contrast="auto"> life for their kids</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> Home-cooked meals together</span><span data-contrast="auto">, </span><span data-contrast="auto">a </span><span data-contrast="auto">clean house, set schedule, </span><span data-contrast="auto">and no need to think about </span><span data-contrast="auto">finance</span><span data-contrast="auto">s</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">are wonderful for a child, but eventually, that child becomes a young adult who needs to live on their own. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">Moving out and dealing with all of these things on your own is like a crash-course in responsibility. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">My whole </span><span data-contrast="auto">being </span><span data-contrast="auto">disa</span><span data-contrast="auto">greed with the fact that mama was</span><span data-contrast="auto"> no longer near, and she would not take care of me waking up on time and having a healthy breakfast. The first few months </span><span data-contrast="auto">of living on my own </span><span data-contrast="auto">were like</span><span data-contrast="auto"> a nightmare where chores fell on my head with no warning.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> Eventually, I learned it all and developed new habits. A</span><span data-contrast="auto"> clean house, </span><span data-contrast="auto">reasonable wake-up time</span><span data-contrast="auto">, finished homework, and my full stomach were consequences of responsible actions I had to take on my own. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">By living on my own, </span><span data-contrast="auto">I learned essential things that I would </span><span data-contrast="auto">never have learned living with my parents.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">It made me more responsible, more mature, and allowed me to understand myself better. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"> </span>
