    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is safe to say the spring season is finally here to stay, and after a long winter, Winnipeg is welcoming it warmly! As we transition out of winter and into spring, every Winnipegger knows that with the warm weather comes rain and slush. When it comes to the spring in Winnipeg, the last thing you want to be is unprepared. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While it may feel like you have to compromise on staying fashionable to be able to remain dry in this weather like there is no point in even trying to stay on trend in the rain, snow, and slush. Don't give up on your style just yet! There are lots of great ways to stay dry and remain in head-to-toe fashion this spring without compromising on your 'outfit of the day' likes.</p>

<h3>Put Your Best Foot Forward</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to navigating the slushy streets of downtown Winnipeg, having footwear that can trudge through the inevitable slush while still looking fresh is a must for your spring wardrobe. A great pair of waterproof boots or shoes will make all the difference when it comes to beating the weather and still looking great going from outside to inside. You want to make sure that you choose shoes that are made waterproof to avoid damaging a great pair that isn't made to withstand the spring conditions. Most pairs of waterproof shoes are made to resist the snow and slush without damaging the fabric, even without a shoe protector, but you still don't want to skip out on that.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->
<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Shoe Protector</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No matter what pair of shoes fits your personal style, make sure you keep them protected from the conditions too. Even though most pairs of waterproof shoes can be worn without a protective spray, no problem, when it comes to the fact that you are going through slush and rain, you do want to do what you can to help keep them in the best condition for as long as possible. Using a protecting spray and cleanser that is made for your shoe material will help them resist wear and tear and prevent the fabric from salt and water damage, keeping them looking fresh year after year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Mukluks</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mukluks are a popular choice in Winnipeg for very good reason. Not only are the traditional Moccasin made perfect for any of Manitoba's conditions, but they also look great and keep you dry and warm in any season. They are great because the rubber sole and waterproof fabrics are made to get you through the worst that mother nature throws at us. I know that I can trust mine to get me from point A to B in the ice and snow or rain and slush without damaging my shoes or my outfit. When it comes to the fur and material of the Mukluks, they are made waterproof to withstand the rain and snow, but you still want to use a protector on these, particularly to keep the fabric and fur in their best condition year after year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Blundstones</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you want something a little more versatile that is great right through from spring to fall, Blundstones and similarly styled shoes are a great option for not only the water and slush, but they are light enough to keep wearing throughout the summer, and it's a bonus that they look great with almost anything. These are fashionable leather ankle boots that are not only trending but versatile. These are a great style when you have to wear them inside and out.</p>

<h3>Rubber Boots</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rubber boots are a cute classic option when you can't get out of staying in and safe from the rain. Make it dry from door to door dry through puddles and slush. You can't go wrong with a pair of rubber boots in your rainy-day wardrobe. With thousands of cute cuts, styles, and accessories to go with them, you are going to end up wanting to wear your rubber boots this spring.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Rubber Boot Liners</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You don't have to compromise style for functionality on days when you have to wear your rubber boots. Rubber boot liners are a fashionable addition that goes with any style. Most brands and companies like Hunter have helped make wearing rubber boots from drab to fab. Not only do they add an extra soft liner for your boot, so you don't have to walk on rubber, but they look great too.</p>

<h3>Classic Rain Coats</h3>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Hats</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another staple of the rainy day wardrobe is, of course, hats! Rain and bucket hats have been making a huge splash with their stylish comeback. Not only are they the missing piece to your rainy-day wardrobe, but they are also one of the staples for staying on trend this season.</p>

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Accessories</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to beating the rain and slush this spring, accessories are key! Winnipeg is known for its unpredictable weather, especially in the spring. We literally have to be prepared to go from snow to rain, and back again all within the same week. Having the right accessories on you could make all the difference in how you, and your clothes, handle the ever-changing spring season.</p>

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Umbrella</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The umbrella is something we all think is overrated until it comes time actually to need one. It goes without saying that everyone should have an umbrella on standby in their closet or bag, just in case of unexpected rainfall or drive-by splashes. Anyone who has waited at a bus stop knows exactly what I'm talking about.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Pocket Poncho</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Be prepared for unexpected rainfall with a pocket poncho. These are great to keep in your bag or your car just in case you are caught in the rain, without a jacket or umbrella. They have come a long way from the plastic bag look they used to come in. You can find many fashionable options that you will actually want to wear that you'll be glad you have on you when you do have to wear them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Spring is one of the most fashionable times of the year, but it can be hard to stay that way when it is almost one of the messiest times of the year. But with these great pieces in your wardrobe, you will be ready for anything without having to compromise on style. It's easy to make the most of the beautiful spring season while navigating through the slushy streets of Winnipeg when your outfit of the day can keep up with our ever-changing conditions as the weather is getting warmer.</p>
