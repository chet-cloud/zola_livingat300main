		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Canadians are increasingly &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.macleans.ca&#x2F;news&#x2F;canada&#x2F;census-2016-a-picture-of-a-bigger-more-urban-canada&#x2F;&quot;&gt;living in cities&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;canadapopulation.org&#x2F;winnipeg-population&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Winnipeg is no exception&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. It can sometimes be hard for communities with fast-growing populations to keep up with the infrastructure needs for new residents. That’s why many cities are gravitating towards more high-density housing as part of their “&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.smartcitiesdive.com&#x2F;ex&#x2F;sustainablecitiescollective&#x2F;urban-density-and-sustainability&#x2F;241696&#x2F;&quot;&gt;smart growth&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;” strategies.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is High-Density Housing?&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
High-density housing simply is housing that packs more people per geographic unit. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;300main.ca&#x2F;&quot;&gt;300 Main&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is a 40-storey apartment building that will be home to several hundred city dwellers. Communities that are urbanizing sometimes encourage developers to add higher-density complexes to their downtown areas. There are many advantages to these tall multiplexes.
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_6065&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;aligncenter&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;1024&amp;quot;]&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;300main.ca&#x2F;&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-6065&quot; src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;livingat300main.ca&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2019&#x2F;11&#x2F;Final_C2-1024x775.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;300 Main Downtown Winnipeg Apartments, Winnipeg Apartments, Downtown Winnipeg Apartments, Apartment Buildings, Apartments in Winnipeg&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;775&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; 3D Rendering of 300 Main[&#x2F;caption]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher-density neighbourhoods have a strong sense of community and connectedness because people are just in closer contact with each other. High-density housing usually entails high-rise buildings such as 300 Main. Higher population density is essential for &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.huffingtonpost.ca&#x2F;ypnexthome&#x2F;high-density-housing-gta_b_17208346.html&quot;&gt;developing busy, vivacious neighbourhoods&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; with lots of features. It allows for beautiful public spaces like downtown Winnipeg to make life convenient, enjoyable and, most importantly, green!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Sustainable Design&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
As cities &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;canada.constructconnect.com&#x2F;dcn&#x2F;news&#x2F;economic&#x2F;2019&#x2F;04&#x2F;canadas-major-cities-ride-slipstream-surging-population-growth&quot;&gt;boom in population&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and invest to meet the needs of their new citizens, sustainability has also become a major focus. High-rise apartments are one of the easiest ways to make a community more sustainable. They have a smaller footprint than that of many smaller buildings.
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_6069&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;aligncenter&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;680&amp;quot;]&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-6069&quot; src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;livingat300main.ca&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2019&#x2F;11&#x2F;apartment-architectural-design-architecture-bridge-1152849-3-680x1024.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;300 Main Downtown Winnipeg Apartments, Winnipeg Apartments, Downtown Winnipeg Apartments, Apartment Buildings, Apartments in Winnipeg, Chicago, High Rise Buildings in Chicago, High Rise Apartments in Chicago&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; height=&quot;1024&quot; &#x2F;&gt; Chicago, United States by Cameron Casey from Pexels[&#x2F;caption]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If neighbourhoods want to continue to grow, all they need to do is look up! Building up, or even on top of, is &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.citylab.com&#x2F;equity&#x2F;2012&#x2F;01&#x2F;why-most-environmental-building-building-weve-already-built&#x2F;1016&#x2F;&quot;&gt;more environmentally-friendly&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; than conventional demolished-site redevelopment.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Size Matters (For Energy)&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
Denser neighbourhoods that include apartment blocks or condos also use less energy. Residences that are stacked or bunched should &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ottawacitizen.com&#x2F;life&#x2F;homes&#x2F;modern-housing-why-highrises-are-good-for-the-environment&quot;&gt;use less energy&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. For example, an apartment suite in 300 Main is more efficient to heat and cool than a detached suburban house. So even on cold winter nights (which us Winnipeggers know sometimes start in October), if every apartment suite were to turn their heat up, they’d be using less energy than the equivalent number of houses. Higher-density neighbourhoods also &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cbsnews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;trying-to-reduce-your-carbon-footprint-dont-fall-for-these-myths&#x2F;&quot;&gt;create fewer harmful emissions&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. As &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.citylab.com&#x2F;life&#x2F;2012&#x2F;04&#x2F;why-bigger-cities-are-greener&#x2F;863&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Richard Florida at CityLab&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; says, “When it comes to greenness, &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;martinprosperity.org&#x2F;insights&#x2F;insight&#x2F;cities-and-co2-bigger-is-better&quot;&gt;size matters&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.”
&lt;h3&gt;Encourages more Walking, Cycling and Use of Public Transportation&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
Though downtown areas can seem busy, there are major benefits to living and working downtown. Dense downtown neighbourhoods help residents drive less and walk more, without giving up their lifestyles. &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fastcompany.com&#x2F;40492045&#x2F;living-in-a-dense-city-makes-citizens-healthier&quot;&gt;Research&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; has shown that lower density promotes sedentary behavior. If your home is far away from the grocery store and your office, you’re going to spend more time in a car and less time being active.
&lt;p&gt;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;livingat300main.ca&#x2F;getting-around-winnipeg-without-a-car-yes-its-possible&#x2F;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-density housing encourages walking and cycling &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cbsnews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;trying-to-reduce-your-carbon-footprint-dont-fall-for-these-myths&#x2F;&quot;&gt;because everything is closer&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; together! Transit is also promoted by high-density housing, as transit connections become more common when neighborhood density increases. Many city dwellers find it more convenient to jump on a transit bus and be at work in a stress-free jiffy, rather than drive to work, deal with traffic, and find parking. Talk about a headache!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individuals who live in suburban areas can also benefit from people taking transit to work. Fewer cars on the road equal fewer harmful emissions, like carbon dioxide.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What’s Big, Green, and Sustainable?&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
High-density housing is a &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;environment&#x2F;georgemonbiot&#x2F;2011&#x2F;jun&#x2F;30&#x2F;sustainable-cities-urban-planning&quot;&gt;sustainable choice&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for growing cities. Tall buildings are more than just towers of concrete and steel; they’re a fundamental part of successful urbanization. They offer a greener, less wasteful, and more energy-efficient way of life.

		<title>Developing your Timeless Style</title>

		<id>https://chet-cloud.github.io/zola_livingat300main/developing-your-timeless-style/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Every time I hear the word “timeless” in relation to fashion or home décor, I feel so much hope. This piece of furniture or pair of shoes will last, will indeed be timeless.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my living room stands a small, mustard-yellow, mid-century sofa. Was this style of sofa fashionable in the 1950s? Absolutely. Is it fashionable today? Certainly. Will it be fashionable in twenty years? I dare say so. Having those three definite answers in mind helped me decide to buy that piece of furniture. Asking if it was timeless helped even more when my subconscious decided I would enjoy this sofa for the next twenty years.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-6036&quot; src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;livingat300main.ca&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2019&#x2F;11&#x2F;inside-weather-Ijk3UP9uRhk-unsplash-2-1024x1024.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Timeless decor, home decor, apartment decor, classic decor, modern decor, redecorating, furniture, buying, apartment style&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;1024&quot; &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some things might be considered fundamentals of timeless fashion, but what’s timeless for each of us might be different. What we decide to call &lt;em&gt;lasting&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;classic&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; depends on our ideas of current and vintage trends. It comes from our backgrounds, preferences, and our feelings.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I might call my yellow sofa timeless, but it might not be something you want to see in your living room every day for the next twenty years. I know why the tweed Chanel suit is considered beautiful and timeless, but it’s just not for me. When it comes to home décor, the same rules apply; each piece of furniture should suit your vision and your lifestyle.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point of such a talky introduction was only to get us thinking about and appreciating the things we own. In a fast-paced world full of issues such as climate change, plastic and fast-fashion production, we ought to pay attention to the quality and durability of our clothes and furniture. Building a wardrobe and home centered on timeless pieces will make a positive difference to both your life and the environment. Let’s look at the process of searching for décor that will last.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Stay away from clichés&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
A home that evokes sighs of admiration with its timeless style wasn&#x27;t decorated in a week. Everything that deserves attention, anything that will last, takes time, love and effort to find. I’m not trying to judge Costco or IKEA. However, I tend to believe in other, more sophisticated and exciting ways of discovering your home essentials.
&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-6038&quot; src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;livingat300main.ca&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2019&#x2F;11&#x2F;ikea-building-1797405-1024x683.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Timeless decor, home decor, apartment decor, classic decor, modern decor, redecorating, furniture, buying, apartment style, ikea&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;683&quot; &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current trends, which tell us to live more organically and embrace slow-fashion and slow-living, affect our ideas about the right way to shop. There are many ways to avoid mass-produced pieces of furniture to find something that will add character to your place that you’ll treasure and enjoy using.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Visit flea markets and antique stores, like &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;antiquesandfunk.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Antiques &amp;amp; Funk&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; or the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thejohnstonterminal.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Johnston Terminal Antique Mall&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Honestly, what compares to the thrill of finding a chair in Louis XIV style, or a set of old chandeliers to make each dinner and party you host sparkle?&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thejohnstonterminal.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-6040 size-large&quot; src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;livingat300main.ca&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2019&#x2F;11&#x2F;Johnston-Terminal-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Timeless decor, home decor, apartment decor, classic decor, modern decor, redecorating, furniture, buying, apartment style, antique store, johnston terminal&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;576&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Try local furniture boutiques. When people hear the word “boutique,” they tend to imagine high-end pieces with high-end prices. But you’d be surprised by the quality you can find at affordable prices My yellow couch, for example, cost just under $600, and the quality and the style are tremendous!&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Frequent local marketplaces that feature artists and makers. These markets, like &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alleywaysmarket.ca&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Alleyways Market&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thirdandbirdevents.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Third + Bird&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, can be found throughout the year in Winnipeg. Many artists will have examples at their booths that can be pre-ordered or purchased on the spot. I’ve found beautiful wooden side tables, kitchen items made from olive wood, and handmade woven baskets that are great for décor and storage.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thirdandbirdevents.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-6042&quot; src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;livingat300main.ca&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2019&#x2F;11&#x2F;https___cdn.evbuc_.com_images_78161255_101463824605_1_original.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;third + bird&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Go treasure hunting at thrift stores and second-hand places. Sure, sometimes you’ll leave empty-handed, but you might also leave with pieces that will suit your style and serve you loyally. Search thrift stores for small details like a magazine stand, books, candelabras or even seasonal decorations. You’ll find unique pieces while doing your part for the environment by reusing, recycling, and restyling.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Add culture to your place&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
My great-grandmother was &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ruska_Roma&quot;&gt;Ruska Roma&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Learning this explained a lot about my preferences. Every time I promised myself that I would keep my house minimalistic, and style it simply with bohemian pieces, I would find something a colourful carpet, golden candle holder, or velvet pillow I couldn’t resist.
&lt;p&gt;Don’t let a fear of being different blind you. Don’t force yourself to follow trends and clichés if you feel no connection to it. I’m not saying to surround yourself with only appropriate cultural pieces. You don’t want your home to be a museum; you want it to be your home that reflects who you are and feels comfortable and warm. Add culture by mixing in art pieces (maybe something you picked up while travelling) with modern furniture for a timeless look.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-6045&quot; src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;livingat300main.ca&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2019&#x2F;11&#x2F;ana-juma-bX-N-0sz8gg-unsplash-768x1024.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Timeless decor, home decor, apartment decor, classic decor, modern decor, redecorating, furniture, buying, apartment style, antique store, bohemian&quot; width=&quot;768&quot; height=&quot;1024&quot; &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine a room where the main pieces, like the sofa, chairs, and table, are simple, but the room feels full of character. Look closer, and you will notice more than basic furniture. Is that a rug from India? Are there French impressionist paintings? Photographs? Are there handmade vases from Poland? Discover what your culture is about and sprinkle it throughout your home.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Let the basics be timeless&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again: everyone has their own interpretation of what makes something timeless. However, there are some standard rules for choosing timeless pieces.
&lt;p&gt;Allow bigger pieces such as sofas, dining tables, kitchen cabinets, and your bed to be timeless. The same rules that apply in fashion apply to interior design: keep your essential wardrobe and basic furniture functional and timeless. Then, add trendy or cultural notes to it seasonally.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-6046&quot; src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;livingat300main.ca&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2019&#x2F;11&#x2F;samantha-gades-BlIhVfXbi9s-unsplash-1024x684.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Timeless decor, home decor, apartment decor, classic decor, modern decor, redecorating, furniture, buying, apartment style&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;684&quot; &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Timeless furniture makes a functional base but doesn&#x27;t have to be boring. Research the epoch you find the most delightful or interesting and be inspired by its designs. Pay attention to descriptions such as “retro”, “mid-century” and “contemporary”; you might even keep an eye out for “Victorian” if you like a bit of pomp. Use these pieces fearlessly as your basics.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If cultural or trendy decorative details suit your personality, then timeless furniture is your neutral base. The more timeless and essential your main furniture is, the longer it will stay with you. You merely won&#x27;t get tired of its appearance and presence.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advice that helped me: start a mood board (physical or just on Pinterest) and do your research. Collect ideas for timeless (but not dull and boring!) interior design pieces. Then, enjoy the slow thrill of the furniture hunt at antique stores, little unknown shops. Search Instagram for artists and handcrafters; you might find unique dish sets, side tables, pillows and baskets. When you’re finished, your home will be more than just a shelter. It will be full of useful, uncommon pieces that have a story behind them; pieces that serve you and express your individuality. And that’s truly timeless.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<title>How to Maximize Your Tiny Kitchen</title>
		<published>2019-08-09T21:05:13+00:00</published>

		<id>https://chet-cloud.github.io/zola_livingat300main/how-to-maximize-your-tiny-kitchen/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My kitchen is tiny. So tiny that guests will walk through it and ask, “Where’s the rest of it?” But I don’t let the size of my kitchen make me shy away from cooking! I’m a foodie, but most importantly, a foodie on a budget—so I cook most of my meals at home.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why I Love Cooking&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
Over the years, I’ve fallen in love with cooking. I walk into my kitchen and the possibilities feel endless! My favourite way to cook is with no plan or recipe. In the kitchen there are no rules, and I love that. In school, work, and even my hobbies I always feel pressure to be creative in a certain way; but cooking is a different kind of creativity, and I can create without limitations!
&lt;p&gt;And because I love cooking so much, I don’t let my small kitchen prevent me from cooking up a storm. Here are some of my favourite ways to use my space!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-5630&quot; src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;livingat300main.ca&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2019&#x2F;08&#x2F;hanging-kitchen-kitchen-utensils-211760-1024x683.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Small kitchen, Organizing Kitchen, 300 Main Apartments, Kitchen Interiors, Kitchen Clutter, Kitchen utensils&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;683&quot; &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Stacking&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
Stacking is your best friend with a tiny kitchen. My kitchen is what some might call an organized mess. As soon as you walk into my space, you’re greeted by my microwave underneath my coffee maker, which is tucked up against my slow cooker, which has three cookbooks stacked neatly on top. Small kitchens usually don’t have room for much horizontal space, but what about vertical space? Start by stacking items that you don’t tend to grab as much, and then stack items that you frequently use together. Not only will you save space, but you’ll also know which stack to pull things from when you’re in a time crunch rather than running around trying to find your food processer or a cookbook.
&lt;h3&gt;2. Clean as You Go&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
Cleaning as you go is a crucial habit for cooking in a small space. You cannot use your space to its fullest potential with pots and food scrapes taking over half of your counter space! This tip is basic, but a total game changer.
&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe style=&quot;border: none; overflow: hidden;&quot; src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.facebook.com&#x2F;plugins&#x2F;post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2F300MainWinnipeg%2Fposts%2F1497982703677591&amp;amp;width=500&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;573&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;iframe&gt;&lt;&#x2F;center&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Use ALL Your Space&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
Utilizing all your space is also a key component to enlarging your kitchen. Try placing a cutting board over your stove top or an open drawer. Use your kitchen table as a prep space or place one of your larger cutting boards over your sink to make extra counter space. Get creative. Just because it isn’t a countertop doesn’t mean it can’t function like one!
&lt;h3&gt;4. Look Up for Utensil Storage&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
Store your utensils up high! I’m very particular about where my utensils go. I recommend that anyone who does a lot of cooking in a small kitchen store their most used utensils, pots, and pans on hooks. If possible, a shallow cubby is a great space to store utensils. I find it very stressful to rifle through drawers in search of my whisk or a medium frying pan. By displaying a few of your most crucial cooking tools, you set yourself up for success!

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kitchen Appliances I Can Vouch For&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
Every birthday and holiday, it seems like a new kitchen appliance is at the top of my list! Here are some of my favourite kitchen appliances that are a must for those of us with limited space.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mini Food Processor&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mini food processor is an essential! Not only is this contraption small, but it’s also a great tool for chopping up food quickly. It saves you so much counter space over clunky cutting boards.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slow Cooker&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slow cookers solve all our problems, honestly. They’re a necessity for those who dread coming home and cooking dinner after their 9-to-5. Just pop in your ingredients in the morning, leave it for the day and boom, a hot meal to welcome you home!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coffee Maker&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good ol’ coffee maker is a must for us downtowners—it’s just a way of life! I have both a coffee maker and an espresso maker, but coffee for me is a lifestyle more than a drink. I think a standard coffee maker is a necessity for all kitchens. Nowadays, they’re so compact they don’t take up much room in your kitchen.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rolling Cart&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While not exactly an appliance, a rolling cart is life-changing! I bought mine from Ikea for $35, but the amount of use I get out of it makes it priceless in my book. I mainly use it to store ingredients and utensils that I need while cooking but don’t have the counter space for. The best part is, once I am done with it I can roll it into a corner and it’s out of my way!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Got any other small kitchen tips and tricks? Let us know in the comments below!&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<title>Won&#x27;t You Be My Neighbour?</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Downtown living can be exciting. You’re in the heart of the city with oodles of entertainment choices right outside your door. In your new digs at 300 Main, you will also have new neighbours, maybe more than you’ve ever had before. &lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{}&quot;&gt; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As adults, we sometimes have trouble making new friends and even introducing ourselves to others. Do you want your neighbours to be more than just nameless faces but don’t know where to start? If so, here are five ideas that just may get you started in meeting those sharing your new living environment. &lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{}&quot;&gt; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Join the Gym&lt;&#x2F;b&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{}&quot;&gt; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
At 300 Main, you’ve got some swanky new amenities, including a gym. There are many good reasons to use these facilities, the most obvious of which are exercise and healthy living. Yes, you could work out in your apartment, but you won’t meet anyone new there. The gym will give you an opportunity to politely check out and maybe meet some of your neighbours. &lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{}&quot;&gt; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.facebook.com&#x2F;plugins&#x2F;post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2F300MainWinnipeg%2Fposts%2F1438523886290140&amp;width=500&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;513&quot; style=&quot;border:none;overflow:hidden&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowTransparency=&quot;true&quot; allow=&quot;encrypted-media&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;iframe&gt;&lt;&#x2F;center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be easier to introduce yourself to someone in the gym, because you already have something in common: a desire to exercise. This gives you a ready-made topic to discuss. Does your possible new bestie have a favourite piece of equipment or a good workout tip? Starting with this type of safe topic gives you a chance to chat and discover if you might have more in common. If they don’t seem like buddy material, stick to your short exercise chat, then go back to working out. Having exercise to do gives you an easy excuse to extract yourself from a conversation that isn’t going well. (The introverted among us always like having an escape plan from awkward conversation.) Remember, less is more. You don’t want to be the pushy type, so don’t monopolize anyone for too long.&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{}&quot;&gt; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your first conversation goes well, you can try to catch this person on the regular at the gym for a while. If you both seem receptive to talking outside of the gym, suggest going for drinks or coffee, something comfortable and short.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-184 size-large&quot; src=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;livingat300main.ca&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2018&#x2F;10&#x2F;Friends-1024x683.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;940&quot; height=&quot;627&quot; &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Join a Social Event or Start a Social Committee&lt;&#x2F;b&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{}&quot;&gt; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;alignright wp-image-225&quot; src=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;livingat300main.ca&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2018&#x2F;10&#x2F;blue-charity-cheerful-1208694-1024x766.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;374&quot; &#x2F;&gt;Does your building hold any social events onsite or organize any group outings? If yes, consider joining one that interests you. If you don’t see any options for social gatherings, consider starting a social committee yourself. You will likely need to talk to building management first, but group outings are another great way to meet people in low-stress situations and see if you have something in common.&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{}&quot;&gt; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also join or start a charitable endeavour in your building. There are many non-profit organizations located downtown, such as&lt;i&gt; Siloam Mission&lt;&#x2F;i&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;&#x2F;i&gt;or&lt;i&gt; Welcome Place&lt;&#x2F;i&gt;, which have volunteer openings.  Alternatively, you could invite your apartment block or floor to raise money as a community. Organizations like the Christmas Cheer Board are always looking for new donors. Any of these options will create an opportunity for you to meet people and help a worthy cause at the same time. &lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{}&quot;&gt; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Start a Conversation in Common Areas&lt;&#x2F;b&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{}&quot;&gt; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
Inevitably, you will see some of your new neighbours in the hall, on the elevator or in the mailroom. One of the easiest ways to meet your neighbours is to pipe up and introduce yourself in these situations. If you’re an extrovert, starting conversations with complete strangers is likely an easy task for you. If you’re an introvert, this will take more effort. &lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{}&quot;&gt; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start with a smile and avoid coming on too strong. Remember, you’ve already got something in common: you live in the same building! Ask what they think of the building, the gym or some other amenity. This should lead to an easy conversation. Chances are good you can converse on this topic for a few minutes, which is all you will have (at most) when you randomly run into people in your building. Remember to give your name and, if you feel comfortable, what floor you live on. You won’t hit it off with every neighbour, so don’t fret if the first few conversations don’t work out. &lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{}&quot;&gt; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Advanced Technique&lt;&#x2F;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;: Throw a Party!&lt;&#x2F;b&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{}&quot;&gt; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
If you’re a sociable sort and like to plan events, consider throwing a party. This might be especially welcome if everyone on the invitee list is new to the building, since most of us like to make friends. &lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{}&quot;&gt; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s best to invite a smallish number of people to a party, maybe everyone on your floor. You can knock on doors, leave messages under doors or invite people you’ve met and with whom you have already exchanged numbers.&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{}&quot;&gt; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep the event low key and don’t try to make people do party games. Be conscientious and keep the volume down. Not everyone will come and you don’t want to tick off the people who share your building. The party could just be an easy brunch (mimosas!) or after work drinks. You don’t have to plan for a six-hour event. If all goes well, you might make a few friends. At least you will have some friendly new acquaintances you can talk to when moving around your building.&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{}&quot;&gt; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Think&lt;&#x2F;b&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;&#x2F;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Beyond Your Building&lt;&#x2F;b&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{}&quot;&gt; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;TextRun SCXW892797&quot; lang=&quot;EN-CA&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-CA&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;NormalTextRun SCXW892797&quot;&gt;It’s great to know people right in your living space, but you don’t have to limit yourself to one spot. Take advantage of your location to meet other downtown denizens. You can try local coffee shops or nightclubs. If you pick a regular time to visit your favourite coffee haunt, you might spot other regulars&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;TextRun SCXW892797&quot; lang=&quot;EN-CA&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-CA&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;NormalTextRun SCXW892797&quot;&gt; and be spotted by them&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;TextRun SCXW892797&quot; lang=&quot;EN-CA&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-CA&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;NormalTextRun SCXW892797&quot;&gt;. It will be less intimidating to start conversations with people who have seen your face a few times.&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.meetup.com&#x2F;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-187 size-medium alignleft&quot; src=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;livingat300main.ca&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2018&#x2F;10&#x2F;meetup.en_-300x158.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;158&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;You can also look for local organizations to join. There are multiple Toastmasters clubs that meet downtown. You can also check out &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.meetup.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;www.meetup.com&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to find information about groups or events downtown that might interest you. You can visit the Millennium Library or sign up for some volunteer work in your neighbourhood. There are so many options for meeting people downtown. Pick one and take the plunge!&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{}&quot;&gt; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Starting Is Often the Hardest Part&lt;&#x2F;b&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{}&quot;&gt; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
Meeting people and making new friends can take some work and some intentionality. Choose not to keep your head down over your phone when you’re in your building.  Show your neighbours you are open to connecting by smiling, making eye contact, and saying “hi” when you can. The truth is, many people are shy and just need an invitation to strike up a conversation.  Before long, you’ll discover that “renters” have become “neighbours”, and “neighbours” have become friends. &lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{}&quot;&gt; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;</content>
