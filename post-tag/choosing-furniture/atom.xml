		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Every time I hear the word “timeless” in relation to fashion or home décor, I feel so much hope. This piece of furniture or pair of shoes will last, will indeed be timeless.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my living room stands a small, mustard-yellow, mid-century sofa. Was this style of sofa fashionable in the 1950s? Absolutely. Is it fashionable today? Certainly. Will it be fashionable in twenty years? I dare say so. Having those three definite answers in mind helped me decide to buy that piece of furniture. Asking if it was timeless helped even more when my subconscious decided I would enjoy this sofa for the next twenty years.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-6036&quot; src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;livingat300main.ca&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2019&#x2F;11&#x2F;inside-weather-Ijk3UP9uRhk-unsplash-2-1024x1024.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Timeless decor, home decor, apartment decor, classic decor, modern decor, redecorating, furniture, buying, apartment style&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;1024&quot; &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some things might be considered fundamentals of timeless fashion, but what’s timeless for each of us might be different. What we decide to call &lt;em&gt;lasting&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;classic&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; depends on our ideas of current and vintage trends. It comes from our backgrounds, preferences, and our feelings.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I might call my yellow sofa timeless, but it might not be something you want to see in your living room every day for the next twenty years. I know why the tweed Chanel suit is considered beautiful and timeless, but it’s just not for me. When it comes to home décor, the same rules apply; each piece of furniture should suit your vision and your lifestyle.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point of such a talky introduction was only to get us thinking about and appreciating the things we own. In a fast-paced world full of issues such as climate change, plastic and fast-fashion production, we ought to pay attention to the quality and durability of our clothes and furniture. Building a wardrobe and home centered on timeless pieces will make a positive difference to both your life and the environment. Let’s look at the process of searching for décor that will last.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Stay away from clichés&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
A home that evokes sighs of admiration with its timeless style wasn&#x27;t decorated in a week. Everything that deserves attention, anything that will last, takes time, love and effort to find. I’m not trying to judge Costco or IKEA. However, I tend to believe in other, more sophisticated and exciting ways of discovering your home essentials.
&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-6038&quot; src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;livingat300main.ca&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2019&#x2F;11&#x2F;ikea-building-1797405-1024x683.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Timeless decor, home decor, apartment decor, classic decor, modern decor, redecorating, furniture, buying, apartment style, ikea&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;683&quot; &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current trends, which tell us to live more organically and embrace slow-fashion and slow-living, affect our ideas about the right way to shop. There are many ways to avoid mass-produced pieces of furniture to find something that will add character to your place that you’ll treasure and enjoy using.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Visit flea markets and antique stores, like &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;antiquesandfunk.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Antiques &amp;amp; Funk&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; or the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thejohnstonterminal.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Johnston Terminal Antique Mall&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Honestly, what compares to the thrill of finding a chair in Louis XIV style, or a set of old chandeliers to make each dinner and party you host sparkle?&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thejohnstonterminal.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-6040 size-large&quot; src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;livingat300main.ca&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2019&#x2F;11&#x2F;Johnston-Terminal-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Timeless decor, home decor, apartment decor, classic decor, modern decor, redecorating, furniture, buying, apartment style, antique store, johnston terminal&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;576&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Try local furniture boutiques. When people hear the word “boutique,” they tend to imagine high-end pieces with high-end prices. But you’d be surprised by the quality you can find at affordable prices My yellow couch, for example, cost just under $600, and the quality and the style are tremendous!&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Frequent local marketplaces that feature artists and makers. These markets, like &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alleywaysmarket.ca&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Alleyways Market&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thirdandbirdevents.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Third + Bird&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, can be found throughout the year in Winnipeg. Many artists will have examples at their booths that can be pre-ordered or purchased on the spot. I’ve found beautiful wooden side tables, kitchen items made from olive wood, and handmade woven baskets that are great for décor and storage.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thirdandbirdevents.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-6042&quot; src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;livingat300main.ca&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2019&#x2F;11&#x2F;https___cdn.evbuc_.com_images_78161255_101463824605_1_original.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;third + bird&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Go treasure hunting at thrift stores and second-hand places. Sure, sometimes you’ll leave empty-handed, but you might also leave with pieces that will suit your style and serve you loyally. Search thrift stores for small details like a magazine stand, books, candelabras or even seasonal decorations. You’ll find unique pieces while doing your part for the environment by reusing, recycling, and restyling.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Add culture to your place&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
My great-grandmother was &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ruska_Roma&quot;&gt;Ruska Roma&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Learning this explained a lot about my preferences. Every time I promised myself that I would keep my house minimalistic, and style it simply with bohemian pieces, I would find something a colourful carpet, golden candle holder, or velvet pillow I couldn’t resist.
&lt;p&gt;Don’t let a fear of being different blind you. Don’t force yourself to follow trends and clichés if you feel no connection to it. I’m not saying to surround yourself with only appropriate cultural pieces. You don’t want your home to be a museum; you want it to be your home that reflects who you are and feels comfortable and warm. Add culture by mixing in art pieces (maybe something you picked up while travelling) with modern furniture for a timeless look.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-6045&quot; src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;livingat300main.ca&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2019&#x2F;11&#x2F;ana-juma-bX-N-0sz8gg-unsplash-768x1024.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Timeless decor, home decor, apartment decor, classic decor, modern decor, redecorating, furniture, buying, apartment style, antique store, bohemian&quot; width=&quot;768&quot; height=&quot;1024&quot; &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine a room where the main pieces, like the sofa, chairs, and table, are simple, but the room feels full of character. Look closer, and you will notice more than basic furniture. Is that a rug from India? Are there French impressionist paintings? Photographs? Are there handmade vases from Poland? Discover what your culture is about and sprinkle it throughout your home.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Let the basics be timeless&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again: everyone has their own interpretation of what makes something timeless. However, there are some standard rules for choosing timeless pieces.
&lt;p&gt;Allow bigger pieces such as sofas, dining tables, kitchen cabinets, and your bed to be timeless. The same rules that apply in fashion apply to interior design: keep your essential wardrobe and basic furniture functional and timeless. Then, add trendy or cultural notes to it seasonally.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-6046&quot; src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;livingat300main.ca&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2019&#x2F;11&#x2F;samantha-gades-BlIhVfXbi9s-unsplash-1024x684.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Timeless decor, home decor, apartment decor, classic decor, modern decor, redecorating, furniture, buying, apartment style&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;684&quot; &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Timeless furniture makes a functional base but doesn&#x27;t have to be boring. Research the epoch you find the most delightful or interesting and be inspired by its designs. Pay attention to descriptions such as “retro”, “mid-century” and “contemporary”; you might even keep an eye out for “Victorian” if you like a bit of pomp. Use these pieces fearlessly as your basics.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If cultural or trendy decorative details suit your personality, then timeless furniture is your neutral base. The more timeless and essential your main furniture is, the longer it will stay with you. You merely won&#x27;t get tired of its appearance and presence.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advice that helped me: start a mood board (physical or just on Pinterest) and do your research. Collect ideas for timeless (but not dull and boring!) interior design pieces. Then, enjoy the slow thrill of the furniture hunt at antique stores, little unknown shops. Search Instagram for artists and handcrafters; you might find unique dish sets, side tables, pillows and baskets. When you’re finished, your home will be more than just a shelter. It will be full of useful, uncommon pieces that have a story behind them; pieces that serve you and express your individuality. And that’s truly timeless.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After spending two years studying, working, and falling in love in Scotland, in October I moved into a one-bedroom suite in the &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theboyceloftsonross.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Boyce Lofts&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; in the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;exchangedistrict.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Exchange District&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. It was the first time I didn’t have to live with roommates, and the first time I didn’t have to move into a furnished apartment. The Boyce Lofts were brand new and no one had lived in the space before me. It was a blank canvas (and not just because of the white walls and white cabinetry), and I was so excited to decorate and furnish it just the way I wanted.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But while my apartment has high ceilings and an open concept, it’s pretty small—at around 500 square feet—and narrow enough that I can’t fit furniture on both sides of the living&#x2F;dining room. So not only did I have to plan out the use of space, but I had to make sure I wasn’t filling the space with too much. I knew my already-small space would feel even smaller with clutter and large furniture. I had to be smart about decorating.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m no design expert, but I like to think I have good taste, and I strongly believe that minimalism is the way forward. Not only does minimalism help reduce consumerism, but it helps you &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.psychologytoday.com&#x2F;ca&#x2F;blog&#x2F;anxiety-zen&#x2F;201612&#x2F;minimalism-when-living-less-means-more-mental-health&quot;&gt;feel&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; unburdened in the place that should matter most—home. So here are some tips on designing your small space.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Storage&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
When you have less space to leave things lying around, you can’t afford to have much clutter! Even if you’re not a messy person, it’s hard to keep things clean and tidy if you simply have too much stuff. It’s easy to accumulate Christmas and birthday gifts you didn’t really want, impulse buys you could’ve done without, and clothing and shoes.
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, I understand that sometimes you just don’t want to be looking at your things, especially if it’s miscellaneous stuff you’re unsure where to store. Small-space living is your chance to get creative!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you move into your small space, purge your belongings. Donate or sell them things you don’t want or need (&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.siloam.ca&#x2F;donate&#x2F;donate&#x2F;?utm_source=google&amp;amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;amp;utm_term=siloam%20mission&amp;amp;utm_campaign=paid&amp;amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAqt7jBRAcEiwAof2uK9QVeCxi4pU-My2leJVWHSvKIY9wy_26stHto4zZ_d46JGC9wNY6qBoCMXwQAvD_BwE&quot;&gt;Siloam Mission&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; gratefully accepts new and gently used clothing!). Not only will you feel unburdened from all these nonessential objects, but your small space will feel bigger and you’ll have more room to work with.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For storing your belongings, opt for open shelving. Closed shelving gives the illusion that your walls are closing in and that the room is even smaller. I have an abundance of kitchen cabinet space, so I use it to store some non-kitchen related items as well.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the bed is a great place to store items you don’t use very often. You can buy long, slim boxes exactly for this purpose, or you can even get a storage bed that has built-in storage under the mattress.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your building has storage lockers, use yours! They’re handy for storing larger items like suitcases, bicycles, and seasonal clothing. Items that are essential, but seasonal, and too clunky to be keeping in your apartment year-long.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Furniture&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
When &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;hutk.ca&#x2F;&quot;&gt;choosing furniture&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for your small space, look for pieces that are light and don’t take up a lot of space, or that give the illusion that they don’t. Avoid big, clunky, overstuffed furniture, and choose pieces that are low to the ground and have exposed legs.
&lt;p&gt;Go for &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.interiorillusions.ca&#x2F;product-category&#x2F;furniture&#x2F;living-room&#x2F;accent-chairs&#x2F;&quot;&gt;sleek armless chairs&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and try transparent coffee tables, which won’t look like they’re taking any room at all. Think about using two small coffee tables instead of one big one that takes up a lot of space.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_3430&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;aligncenter&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;940&amp;quot;]&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-3430&quot; src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;livingat300main.ca&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2019&#x2F;03&#x2F;by-interior_illusions-1024x1024.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Interior Illusions, Interior Design, Small Space, Downtown Apartments, 300 Main Downtown Winnipeg Apartments&quot; width=&quot;940&quot; height=&quot;940&quot; &#x2F;&gt; by @interior_illusions on Instagram[&#x2F;caption]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dual or multipurpose pieces are key in a small space. Consider getting an ottoman instead of a coffee table so it can do double duty as extra seating. (Bonus points if it has built-in storage!) Floor cushions also make great emergency seating for when you have guests over, and you can stack them up when you’re not using them.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look into getting an expandable or folding dining table. Keep it small when you’re alone and open it up to fit all your friends around the table the next time you’re hosting brunch.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For storing things like books and &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;intothemusic.ca&#x2F;&quot;&gt;records&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, opt for a shelving unit that is vertical, not horizontal. You’ll be able to store more items while taking up less floor space. If you can, install floating shelves to avoid using up precious square footage. They’re sleek, easy to set up, and you can arrange them however you like.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A TV media console can take up a lot of space, so mount your television on the wall to minimize the use of floor space. I took it a step further and got a projector—they’re cheaper, much smaller, easily transportable, and a great alternative to a clunky television if you have white walls.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Decoration&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
Plants are the easiest way to decorate and brighten up your space. If you have a history of being bad at keeping plants alive (guilty as charged!), try a cactus or a bonsai; they’re small, cute, and can withstand being over or under watered. Stop by &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;verdeplantdesign.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Verde Plant Design&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for a great selection!
&lt;p&gt;Don’t be afraid to decorate your walls with &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wag.ca&#x2F;visit&#x2F;shop&quot;&gt;art&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; that you love. Mirrors make a space look larger, so go on the hunt for a mirror with a stylish frame. A stylish mirror can function as part of your decor, not just something you check to make sure you look good before heading out the door.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hang your curtains from the ceiling, not at the top of the window frame—it’ll create the illusion of higher ceilings and a larger space.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to creating a colour palette for a small space, use colour sparingly. Use light colours for your walls and furniture, and dark or bold colours as accents only, such as throw pillows, vases, or lamps. Try to create a colour palette that uses only two to three colours.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Getting Started&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
Where do you spend the most time? Focus your spending on that area to get the most out of your budget. If you like sleeping, invest in a bed you can’t wait to crawl into; if you like watching TV, invest in a cozy sofa; if you work from home, invest in a good working space, with a comfy chair and a nice desk. Make a plan, and don’t buy everything at once. Get the important things like your bed and your sofa first, live with it for a bit, and feel out what you need to get next; you might surprise yourself!
