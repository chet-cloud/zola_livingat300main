		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The arts scene is a huge part of what makes Winnipeg so special, and the &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;winnipegarts.ca&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Winnipeg Arts Council&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; has a lot to do with that. Since 2004, the Council has facilitated art displays in public spaces across Winnipeg through the &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;winnipegarts.ca&#x2F;pubart-about&quot;&gt;Public Art Program&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. While many of these stunning pieces are downtown⁠—like the “&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;winnipegarts.ca&#x2F;wac&#x2F;artwork&#x2F;electrical-currents&quot;&gt;Electrical Currents&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;” piece at &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;downtownwinnipegbiz.com&#x2F;business&#x2F;air-canada-window-park&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Air Canada Park&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;⁠—others are scattered across the city, like the “&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;winnipegarts.ca&#x2F;wac&#x2F;artwork&#x2F;living-living-room&quot;&gt;Living Living Room&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.”&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_5750&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;aligncenter&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;720&amp;quot;]&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;winnipegarts.ca&#x2F;wac&#x2F;artwork&#x2F;electrical-currents&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-5750&quot; src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;livingat300main.ca&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2019&#x2F;08&#x2F;by-D-Works-Media.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Public Arts Winnipeg, Public Arts, Arts, Living Living Room, Winnipeg Arts Council, Winnipeg Arts, Winnipeg Downtown, Downtown Winnipeg&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; Photo by D Works Media from Winnipeg Arts Council Website[&#x2F;caption]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This incredible living art piece was created by Winnipeg artist and landscape designer &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;c2centreforcraft.ca&#x2F;gallery&#x2F;erica-swendrowski&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Erica Swendrowski&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; in 2011. With the “Living Living Room”, Erica combined her landscape architecture training and her passion for sculpture with the idea to create household objects made purely of the earth. By combining a creative art display with an environmentally-conscious gardening, this piece enriches the human experience creatively and collectively. Erica made the living room garden a beautiful piece of art that people can really connect with.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_5753&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;aligncenter&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;720&amp;quot;]&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;winnipegarts.ca&#x2F;wac&#x2F;artwork&#x2F;living-living-room&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-5753&quot; src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;livingat300main.ca&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2019&#x2F;08&#x2F;NI8ugsmh-720-478.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Public Arts Winnipeg, Public Arts, Arts, Living Living Room, Winnipeg Arts Council, Winnipeg Arts, Winnipeg Downtown, Downtown Winnipeg&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; height=&quot;478&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; Orioles Community Centre, living living room by Erica Swendrowski — Photo by Robert Tinker[&#x2F;caption]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her proposal for the project, Erica wrote, “For generations, community gardens have provided city dwellers with opportunities to grow healthy food close to home.” Erica’s “living living rooms” were integrated into community gardens at the &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;valourcc.ca&#x2F;facilities&#x2F;orioles&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Orioles Community Centre&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;lordrobertscc.ca&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Lord Roberts Community Centre&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and the Millennium Garden. The project’s ambitions were to connect local gardeners and to help new relationships “blossom”.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first saw the piece, I was in awe of Erica’s ability to create something that felt so familiar. Living rooms are places of comfort, where we gather with friends and family; they’re filled with memories of holidays, parties and cuddling up to watch your favourite tv shows. Building something that feels so homey encourages people to feel welcomed. I think that sense of togetherness probably made more people want to participate in up-keeping the community gardens where Erica built her creations.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_5754&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;aligncenter&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;720&amp;quot;]&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;winnipegarts.ca&#x2F;wac&#x2F;artwork&#x2F;living-living-room&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-5754&quot; src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;livingat300main.ca&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2019&#x2F;08&#x2F;3BZHoy2N-720-478.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Public Arts Winnipeg, Public Arts, Arts, Living Living Room, Winnipeg Arts Council, Winnipeg Arts, Winnipeg Downtown, Downtown Winnipeg&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; height=&quot;478&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; Garden Bus Tour, West Broadway, living living room by Erica Swendrowski — Photo by Robert Tinker[&#x2F;caption]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also appreciate the creative relationship between the traditionally-shaped living room “furniture” and the earthy materials and tones. As a place to spend time together, living rooms are a central part of our homes. The natural materials of these pieces remind us that ultimately, the earth is the home we all share.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Winnipeg, we’re lucky to have green spaces throughout the city. I hope these pieces helped those who saw them connect with the idea of how important it is to take care of the environment.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<title>Rent vs Buy: Which is Right For You?</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;To rent or to buy, that is the question. It’s been analysed, discussed and debated for a long time, but it’s never been more relevant than today: Based on a &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cbc.ca&#x2F;news&#x2F;canada&#x2F;calgary&#x2F;calgary-rent-vs-buy-reader-response-road-ahead-1.4503852&quot;&gt;Calgary survey&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, young professionals who can afford to buy a house still prefer to rent. I’ve heard doctors, teachers, and other professionals argue that they find renting more convenient than buying.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I rented for more than four years before buying a home, and I think renting is an underrated option. People will always have different opinions, and I find myself somewhere in between. I enjoy home ownership just outside of the city; I also enjoyed renting a 17&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;-floor apartment in downtown Winnipeg. Home ownership isn’t for everyone, and I’m here to show you that renting a home has more advantages than you might think.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Renting is more affordable.&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
When you purchase a home, you don&#x27;t just pay for the property itself. You can also look forward to taxes, mortgage interest and other fees. In addition to those basics, there will be other expenses depending on the type of property you buy. We purchased a duplex, and it wasn’t long before the extra costs started to add up: gardens, fencing, driveways and landscaping are expensive!
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the true cost of homeownership is not as simple as comparing a monthly mortgage payment to a rent payment. Don’t even get me started on condo fees, utilities and insurance. When buying a house, you also need to be sure that you can afford to put down a &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.canada.ca&#x2F;en&#x2F;financial-consumer-agency&#x2F;services&#x2F;mortgages&#x2F;down-payment.html&quot;&gt;minimum of 5% for the down payment&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Renters, on the other hand, don’t need to worry about most of these expenses.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-3440 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;livingat300main.ca&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2019&#x2F;03&#x2F;account-bank-banking-1548994-1024x610.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;bank loan, mortgage insurance, buying a house, renting an apartment, winnipeg apartments&quot; width=&quot;940&quot; height=&quot;560&quot; &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;No need to pay for maintenance.&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
Maintenance is such a huge factor that I think it deserves its own category. Here’s a great (and stinky) story about how well maintenances are usually completed by a rental company: When my husband and I came back to Winnipeg from our honeymoon in the Dominican Republic, it was almost midnight. We were tired but woke right up when we opened the door to our apartment. It smelled like something had &lt;em&gt;died&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; in there. I ran to throw open the window, and my husband checked the kitchen.
&lt;p&gt;It turned out that the fridge had stopped working, and the contents of the fridge and freezer (including chicken, fish, and veggies) had been rotting for 2 weeks—yuck. You can imagine the smell! Long story short, we called the property management office, and they immediately replaced our fridge. It didn&#x27;t cost us a penny. Convinced yet? Let’s move on to the next point.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Renting = flexibility.&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
Usually, a rental lease is signed for a year, and then you have the option to renew. This way you have way more freedom in planning ahead. However, sometimes even the best-planned life scenario can be ruined by unplanned situations. It could be a sudden job offer in a different city, a family emergency, or you could just decide to move because the world is a beautiful place and you have to see more of it!
&lt;p&gt;If you rent, you don&#x27;t have to deal with selling a house. Renting offers valuable convenience when it comes to a quick change of plans. It saves you from looking for a buyer, paying a realtor, signing papers, and looking for a new place to buy. Hand over they keys to your landlord when your lease is up, and you’re free to move on.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-3444 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;livingat300main.ca&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2019&#x2F;03&#x2F;rawpixel-589079-unsplash-1024x728.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Winnipeg Apartments, Renting vs Buying, Downtown Apartments, Downtown Living, 300 Main Winnipeg Apartments&quot; width=&quot;940&quot; height=&quot;668&quot; &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Renting involves less emotional and financial stress.&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
If you’ve ever been interested in buying a property, you’ve probably noticed that interest rates are rising. Mortgage interest rates are the highest they’ve been in 5 years, and it looks like they are destined to climb even more.
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, if you cannot afford to put down 20% as a down payment, you are required to purchase mortgage insurance. Just to give a point of reference, we had to pay close to $10,000 in &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca&#x2F;en&#x2F;buying&#x2F;mortgage-loan-insurance-for-consumers&quot;&gt;mortgage insurance&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; on a house purchase in the mid-$300,000 range. Property taxes in most cities have also been increasing. Taxes and interest rates add a substantial cost to home ownership that sometimes makes buying a home financially unfeasible.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to popular belief, renting isn’t a money drain. You’re paying for the roof above your head and shelter for your family. You can save on monthly expenditures and have more flexibility when it comes to your life plans. Get the most bang for your buck by investing any money that you save monthly by renting instead of owning. Over 40 years, a diversified investment portfolio can yield an equal or even greater return than investing in buying a home. Renting a place doesn’t make you a homeowner, but it does free up cash flow that might otherwise be going to taxes, a mortgage, and unexpected expenses.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Make the decision that’s right for you&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
The decision whether to buy or rent a home shouldn’t be made lightly. It should involve being honest with yourself about what you want, what you need, and lists—lots of lists with numbers that will show you the advantages and disadvantages of either decision. Consider your lifestyle, your finances, and your plans. Whatever you decide, make the right decision for &lt;em&gt;you&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, and don’t worry about what others think.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now, let’s hear your opinion! If you have ever faced the dilemma of buying or renting, share your experience in comments below.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
