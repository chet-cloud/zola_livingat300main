		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Have you ever been to a restaurant, bar or even hotel that just speaks to you? Maybe you’re drawn in by the menu, the decor, the service, or a beautiful combination of all three. Or maybe it has that certain &lt;em&gt;je ne sais quoi&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;smithrestaurant.ca&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Smith Restaurant&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; in the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.innforks.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Inn at the Forks&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is one of those places.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re enjoying a staycation, a family gathering, or looking for a more intimate &lt;em&gt;rendezvous&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; (yes, even for breakfast), Smith Restaurant should be at the top of your list.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The setting&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
Country chic. Comfortable. Warm and modern. In a nutshell, Smith’s interior is a blend of styles with something to appeal to everyone. And, given that Smith is a popular spot not only for breakfast but dinner and the after-dinner crowd as well, its appeal transcends the morning hours. Let’s call it &lt;em&gt;Canadiana&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; fusion, with wood features, modern lighting, leather and benches covered in &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thebay.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Hudson’s Bay&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; point blankets.

&lt;h3&gt;The service&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
Professional and yet personable fits the service to a tee. From the host, who was unfazed when we showed up early for our reservation, to our server Angela, with whom we shared a few good laughs. The service matched the situation and exceeded our expectations.
&lt;h3&gt;The menu&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
“Not your mama’s eggs” comes to mind when describing the menu. Not that there is anything wrong with her eggs, but Smith’s chefs have succeeded in creating a menu that features local, seasonal, and Canadian products, which really bumps those eggs up to the next level. Sure, you can order the Hotel Breakfast—which consists of some good old-fashioned eggs with a choice of bacon or sausage—or oatmeal (with a Saskatoon berry twist), but there are a few more interesting options.

&lt;p&gt;My favourite of those interesting options is the Eggs Copenhagen. It might be the Scandinavian blood in me, but the Eggs Copenhagen called, and I was not disappointed. Two poached eggs with smoked lox and rösti potato came together nicely. Of course, no breakfast would be complete without a good cup of tea or coffee, and here, too, we pleasantly surprised.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the usual selection of teas, cappuccino, espresso, and Americano coffees, Smith offers a French press coffee option. We gave the French press a try, and it was exquisite.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking to kick off your day with some good food, give Smith a try. Perhaps you, too, will find that it has that &lt;em&gt;je ne sais quoi&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

This isn’t surprising, since restaurants in hotels are typically pricier.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;While most of us love the idea of having our own space to do exactly what we want in, the reality is that living alone can be expensive. It can also be lonely, so some of us choose to have roommates for companionship. Whatever your reasons might be, living with roommates can be a lovely—or disastrous—experience.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Good&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
Splitting living costs means you have more money for other things. You can also create great memories with roommates. I’ve had roomies off and on in my life, particularly in my university years. One of my favourite aspects of living with others is the meshing of traditions and cultures around the holidays. One year, three of us celebrated Christmas and two celebrated Hanukkah. We decided to mash everything together and made a Chrismukkah tree. It was a traditional Christmas evergreen tree, but we covered it in blue and silver decorations (the colours of Hannukah) and used a big Star of David as a tree topper. It was fun watching the roomies who’d never had a tree try to figure out how to hang balls and baubles, as those little squeezable hooks aren’t really used for anything but Christmas decorations. We also got to teach our roommates all of the lyrics to cheesy Christmas songs. And later that school year, I learned how to celebrate Passover. We always enjoyed our combined holiday events.
&lt;p&gt;Being students, we had lots of silly drunken nights and sometimes came up with imaginative solutions to our problems. We had been given a TV by one set of parents, but it had no remote control. We were entirely too lazy to get up and change the channel, so one night we found some duct tape and taped all of our wooden spoons and spatulas together in a long line that reached from the couch to the TV. It served as a handy, and remarkably sturdy, remote control for the rest of the year.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And having roommates means there is often someone there to talk to and do things with without having to schedule plans days in advance, which is a nice bonus.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Bad&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
Having roomies isn’t always idyllic. Living with others is often fraught with annoyances and drama. One of the most common fights is over cleanliness, or lack thereof. I’m sure our bathrooms were teeming with germs, as no one ever wanted to clean them. We had the same problem with dishes. No one ever believed it was their turn to wash, so the dishes just piled up in the sink in ever-teetering towers.
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_2955&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;aligncenter&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;900&amp;quot;]&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-2955&quot; src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;livingat300main.ca&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2019&#x2F;01&#x2F;rawpixel-804799-unsplash-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;dirty dishes, dirty kitchen, messy kitchen. apartment living, living with roommates, roomies, winnipeg apartments, 300 Main apartments, downtown winnipeg&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;612&quot; &#x2F;&gt; ? by rawpixel on Unsplash[&#x2F;caption]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your best bet to avoid similar problems is to have a conversation with your roomies right at the start, to decide what is and isn’t acceptable for everyone. You may also want to create a chore schedule so everyone knows exactly who will be doing what and by when.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another issue can be sharing food or other resources. You should decide right away if you are sharing food or keeping things completely separate. This does not guarantee success, by the way. We had one roommate in university (I’m calling her Jane to protect the guilty) who never bought her own food and pilfered from everyone else when we weren’t around. It wasn’t something we were able to successfully stop, and it was one of the reasons she ended up moving out before the year was up.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Ugly&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
Some problems grow from small to breathtakingly bad. We had one roommate (surprisingly, not Jane) come back from summer break in second year with a large package in tow. She worked on her parents’ travelling carnival every summer. That year, she had fallen for a 6’8” carny and decided to bring him back to university with her. He was supposed to stay a few days, maybe a week or two, before finding his own place. He never left. He spent the entire year living with us, moving from job to job, and never contributed anything towards rent or utilities. It was an ongoing fight all year to get him to pay up or move out, but we didn’t get the big mooch to leave until we all moved out at the end of the school year.
&lt;p&gt;Most roommate situations don’t turn out this badly, but it’s important to know something about the person you are living with and to set clear ground rules from the start. It’s no fun if you suddenly find yourself in need of a new living situation because things have become untenable at home.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;And the Downright Weird&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
Some roommate situations just become weird. Like Jane, who had a revolving door of friends constantly in our apartment. It’s a little disconcerting to walk into your bathroom at 7 am and find some guy you’ve never met before passed out over your toilet. (Hello, awkward conversation.)
&lt;p&gt;In our student apartment building, people regularly set off the fire alarm with burned popcorn and toast. But when Jane decided it would be a great idea to butt a cigarette into a wastebasket full of paper, the ensuing full-fledged fire didn’t set off the alarms until our apartment was fully consumed by smoke. Most of the damage was contained to her room, but the entire apartment had a distinctly smoky smell for weeks after. I guess my tip here is to choose your roommates wisely.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Bottom Line&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
[caption id=&quot;attachment_2957&quot; align=&quot;aligncenter&quot; width=&quot;900&quot;]&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-2957&quot; src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;livingat300main.ca&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2019&#x2F;01&#x2F;kelly-sikkema-411622-unsplash-1024x678.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Sticky notes, delegating, tasks, communication, assertive, apartment living, downtown Winnipeg, 300 Main Apartments&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;596&quot; &#x2F;&gt; ? by Kelly Sikkema on Unsplash[&#x2F;caption]
&lt;p&gt;There are benefits and drawbacks both to living alone and with others. You need to pick the option that best works for you. If you have roommates, spend a little time making the right choice or you could spend a lot of time regretting it. Set clear ground rules and expectations, and be prepared to have frank discussions when things don’t run smoothly. This happens sometimes, even with great roommates. And if you have some bad experiences, remind yourself they make great fodder for party stories later. (And share them below!)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Downtown living can be exciting. You’re in the heart of the city with oodles of entertainment choices right outside your door. In your new digs at 300 Main, you will also have new neighbours, maybe more than you’ve ever had before. &lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{}&quot;&gt; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As adults, we sometimes have trouble making new friends and even introducing ourselves to others. Do you want your neighbours to be more than just nameless faces but don’t know where to start? If so, here are five ideas that just may get you started in meeting those sharing your new living environment. &lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{}&quot;&gt; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Join the Gym&lt;&#x2F;b&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{}&quot;&gt; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
At 300 Main, you’ve got some swanky new amenities, including a gym. There are many good reasons to use these facilities, the most obvious of which are exercise and healthy living. Yes, you could work out in your apartment, but you won’t meet anyone new there. The gym will give you an opportunity to politely check out and maybe meet some of your neighbours. &lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{}&quot;&gt; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.facebook.com&#x2F;plugins&#x2F;post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2F300MainWinnipeg%2Fposts%2F1438523886290140&amp;width=500&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;513&quot; style=&quot;border:none;overflow:hidden&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowTransparency=&quot;true&quot; allow=&quot;encrypted-media&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;iframe&gt;&lt;&#x2F;center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be easier to introduce yourself to someone in the gym, because you already have something in common: a desire to exercise. This gives you a ready-made topic to discuss. Does your possible new bestie have a favourite piece of equipment or a good workout tip? Starting with this type of safe topic gives you a chance to chat and discover if you might have more in common. If they don’t seem like buddy material, stick to your short exercise chat, then go back to working out. Having exercise to do gives you an easy excuse to extract yourself from a conversation that isn’t going well. (The introverted among us always like having an escape plan from awkward conversation.) Remember, less is more. You don’t want to be the pushy type, so don’t monopolize anyone for too long.&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{}&quot;&gt; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your first conversation goes well, you can try to catch this person on the regular at the gym for a while. If you both seem receptive to talking outside of the gym, suggest going for drinks or coffee, something comfortable and short.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-184 size-large&quot; src=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;livingat300main.ca&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2018&#x2F;10&#x2F;Friends-1024x683.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;940&quot; height=&quot;627&quot; &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Join a Social Event or Start a Social Committee&lt;&#x2F;b&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{}&quot;&gt; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;alignright wp-image-225&quot; src=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;livingat300main.ca&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2018&#x2F;10&#x2F;blue-charity-cheerful-1208694-1024x766.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;374&quot; &#x2F;&gt;Does your building hold any social events onsite or organize any group outings? If yes, consider joining one that interests you. If you don’t see any options for social gatherings, consider starting a social committee yourself. You will likely need to talk to building management first, but group outings are another great way to meet people in low-stress situations and see if you have something in common.&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{}&quot;&gt; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also join or start a charitable endeavour in your building. There are many non-profit organizations located downtown, such as&lt;i&gt; Siloam Mission&lt;&#x2F;i&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;&#x2F;i&gt;or&lt;i&gt; Welcome Place&lt;&#x2F;i&gt;, which have volunteer openings.  Alternatively, you could invite your apartment block or floor to raise money as a community. Organizations like the Christmas Cheer Board are always looking for new donors. Any of these options will create an opportunity for you to meet people and help a worthy cause at the same time. &lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{}&quot;&gt; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Start a Conversation in Common Areas&lt;&#x2F;b&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{}&quot;&gt; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
Inevitably, you will see some of your new neighbours in the hall, on the elevator or in the mailroom. One of the easiest ways to meet your neighbours is to pipe up and introduce yourself in these situations. If you’re an extrovert, starting conversations with complete strangers is likely an easy task for you. If you’re an introvert, this will take more effort. &lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{}&quot;&gt; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start with a smile and avoid coming on too strong. Remember, you’ve already got something in common: you live in the same building! Ask what they think of the building, the gym or some other amenity. This should lead to an easy conversation. Chances are good you can converse on this topic for a few minutes, which is all you will have (at most) when you randomly run into people in your building. Remember to give your name and, if you feel comfortable, what floor you live on. You won’t hit it off with every neighbour, so don’t fret if the first few conversations don’t work out. &lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{}&quot;&gt; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Advanced Technique&lt;&#x2F;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;: Throw a Party!&lt;&#x2F;b&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{}&quot;&gt; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
If you’re a sociable sort and like to plan events, consider throwing a party. This might be especially welcome if everyone on the invitee list is new to the building, since most of us like to make friends. &lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{}&quot;&gt; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s best to invite a smallish number of people to a party, maybe everyone on your floor. You can knock on doors, leave messages under doors or invite people you’ve met and with whom you have already exchanged numbers.&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{}&quot;&gt; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep the event low key and don’t try to make people do party games. Be conscientious and keep the volume down. Not everyone will come and you don’t want to tick off the people who share your building. The party could just be an easy brunch (mimosas!) or after work drinks. You don’t have to plan for a six-hour event. If all goes well, you might make a few friends. At least you will have some friendly new acquaintances you can talk to when moving around your building.&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{}&quot;&gt; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Think&lt;&#x2F;b&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;&#x2F;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Beyond Your Building&lt;&#x2F;b&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{}&quot;&gt; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;TextRun SCXW892797&quot; lang=&quot;EN-CA&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-CA&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;NormalTextRun SCXW892797&quot;&gt;It’s great to know people right in your living space, but you don’t have to limit yourself to one spot. Take advantage of your location to meet other downtown denizens. You can try local coffee shops or nightclubs. If you pick a regular time to visit your favourite coffee haunt, you might spot other regulars&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;TextRun SCXW892797&quot; lang=&quot;EN-CA&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-CA&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;NormalTextRun SCXW892797&quot;&gt; and be spotted by them&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;TextRun SCXW892797&quot; lang=&quot;EN-CA&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-CA&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;NormalTextRun SCXW892797&quot;&gt;. It will be less intimidating to start conversations with people who have seen your face a few times.&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.meetup.com&#x2F;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-187 size-medium alignleft&quot; src=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;livingat300main.ca&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2018&#x2F;10&#x2F;meetup.en_-300x158.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;158&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;You can also look for local organizations to join. There are multiple Toastmasters clubs that meet downtown. You can also check out &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.meetup.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;www.meetup.com&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to find information about groups or events downtown that might interest you. You can visit the Millennium Library or sign up for some volunteer work in your neighbourhood. There are so many options for meeting people downtown. Pick one and take the plunge!&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{}&quot;&gt; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Starting Is Often the Hardest Part&lt;&#x2F;b&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{}&quot;&gt; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
Meeting people and making new friends can take some work and some intentionality. Choose not to keep your head down over your phone when you’re in your building.  Show your neighbours you are open to connecting by smiling, making eye contact, and saying “hi” when you can. The truth is, many people are shy and just need an invitation to strike up a conversation.  Before long, you’ll discover that “renters” have become “neighbours”, and “neighbours” have become friends. &lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{}&quot;&gt; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;</content>
