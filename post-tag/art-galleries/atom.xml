		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Downtown Winnipeg is known for having the most frigid intersection in the city at Portage and Main, heritage buildings in Exchange District, beautiful blooming trees on the Manitoba legislature grounds, and art galleries. It’s also known for its selection of unique, classy coffee shops. Downtown coffee shops don’t just serve espresso drinks to get you through the day; they also offer a cozy, relaxing place to unwind.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve explored coffee shops in downtown Winnipeg from Main Street to Broadway, proving there are many satisfying options for holding meetings, working, chatting, or just spending quality time alone with a good book. When people ask me what to do in Winnipeg or where they can grab a good cup of coffee, I say two magic words: &lt;em&gt;Forth&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Parlour&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. Of course, those are just the highlights⁠—here are five options for where to get your caffeine fix downtown.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.foolsandhorses.ca&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Fools &amp;amp; Horses &lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
This coffee shop is located at 379 Broadway (plus another location at the Forks), and you can imagine how busy it gets. During the lunch rush, you’re lucky if you manage to snag a seat. To keep pace, the staff is very energetic and friendly. I won’t bother mentioning that they have great coffee⁠—obviously they do, or this place wouldn’t be on the list! Instead, I want to highlight the interior. My forever-favourite part about Fools and Horses is the humongous wooden table right in the middle of the shop. The table is surrounded by mint and silver iron chairs, which are usually filled with students. I can’t count how many random but totally pleasant chats I’ve while sitting there, sipping a delicious cappuccino.
&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe style=&quot;border: none; overflow: hidden;&quot; src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.facebook.com&#x2F;plugins&#x2F;post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Ffoolswpg%2Fposts%2F882303228629504&amp;amp;width=500&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;604&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;iframe&gt;&lt;&#x2F;center&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;parlourcoffee.ca&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Parlour&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
The first thing that literally hit my eye when I walked into tiny Parlour was the writing on the wall. &lt;em&gt;“No Wi-Fi. Talk to your neighbour.”&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; I was amazed to see my own philosophy of old-fashioned communication reflected in a coffee shop. That day, I got a cup of hot chocolate, a croissant, and walked out having decided to become a regular customer at 468 Main Street. The shop itself is small, but very cozy. They don’t have the usual tables and chairs, just wooden bar chairs and counters lining the walls and window. Grab a spot by the window for the best view of Main Street. Thanks to their friendly baristas, welcoming atmosphere and high-quality coffee, you’ll find an impeccable place to hide from the rain with a good book or for a chat with a stranger.
&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe style=&quot;border: none; overflow: hidden;&quot; src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.facebook.com&#x2F;plugins&#x2F;post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fparlourcoffee%2Fposts%2F2492837500767216%3A0&amp;amp;width=500&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;490&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;iframe&gt;&lt;&#x2F;center&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thombargen.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Thom Bargen&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
Thom Bargen has two locations in Winnipeg, but I love the café at 250 Kennedy Street. Thom Bargen is the only place in Winnipeg that serves &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;philsebastian.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Phil &amp;amp; Sebastian coffee&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; beans. If you’re a coffee lover like myself, you’ll appreciate the selection Thom Bargen offers. They also feature special guest roasters that change monthly. My favourites so far have been Monogram and Anchored.
&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe style=&quot;border: none; overflow: hidden;&quot; src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.facebook.com&#x2F;plugins&#x2F;post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FDowntownPeggy%2Fposts%2F2500409343313725&amp;amp;width=500&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;681&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;iframe&gt;&lt;&#x2F;center&gt;Thom Bargen is also known for its beautiful tiny marble tables, and prime location in a beautiful part of downtown. The café is framed by the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rwb.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Royal Winnipeg Ballet&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; on one side, and a small bookshop that has a huge selection of old and rare editions on the other. The Kennedy location also has the most Instagram-worthy plant wall! It makes the café feel fresh and summery on even the coldest days.
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stellas.ca&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Stella’s&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
While not technically a coffee shop, Stella’s deserves a mention when discussing coffee in downtown Winnipeg. The Stella’s location at 110 Sherbrook is a &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stellas.ca&#x2F;bakery&#x2F;&quot;&gt;bakery&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;-plus-restaurant combo across two buildings. While I highly recommend the restaurant for breakfast or lunch, today I want to highlight the bakery. Step inside, take in a breath of air warm with freshly baked bread, order a latte and chocolate croissant, and nestle in at one of the tiny wooden tables in the corner. The bakery feels meant for quiet conversations or a quick getaway from responsibilities. A word of advice: When hunting for a chocolate croissant, make sure to get there in the morning. The famous pastries at Stella’s fly out the door as soon as they open.
&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe style=&quot;border: none; overflow: hidden;&quot; src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.facebook.com&#x2F;plugins&#x2F;post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FStellascafebakery%2Fposts%2F2142578272457783%3A0&amp;amp;width=500&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;614&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;iframe&gt;&lt;&#x2F;center&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.instagram.com&#x2F;forth_wpg&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Forth&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
I saved the most unique and loved café for last. Forth is known for its square wooden tables, plants, and stand of newspapers from different cities. It’s also beloved for its rooftop patio, which offers amazing views from May to October (weather permitting). You can see both the modern part of downtown and the heritage buildings of the Exchange District. The contrast is breathtaking.
&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-5583&quot; src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;livingat300main.ca&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2019&#x2F;07&#x2F;IMG_2441-768x1024.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Coffee Shops In Downtown Winnipeg, downtown Winnipeg, winnipeg cafe, winnipeg coffee shops, downtown winnipeg coffee shops, coffee shops in the exchange district, exchange district, coffee in exchange district, exchange district coffee&quot; width=&quot;768&quot; height=&quot;1024&quot; &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forth doesn’t just serve espresso drinks. They serve a small menu of snacks, salads, and some alcoholic beverages. The rooftop bar is the most stylish and minimalist-looking bar I’ve seen in Winnipeg. When you visit, indulge in the avocado toast, as it will just melt on your tongue. The shop is in a historical building at 171 McDermot. The &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mhs.mb.ca&#x2F;docs&#x2F;sites&#x2F;dawsonrichardsonbuilding.shtml&quot;&gt;Dawson Richardson Building&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; was built in 1921 to become the Grain Trade News publishing house. When inside, you might feel you can still catch the smell of old typographical papers and hear the click-clack of typewriter keys.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let us know about your favourite downtown Winnipeg coffee shop. Leave a comment, and add to this list. As always, enjoy your cup of coffee!&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<title>Exploring First Fridays in the Exchange</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On the first Friday of every month, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.exchangedistrict.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Winnipeg’s Exchange District&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; comes alive as galleries, restaurants, and boutiques open their doors after-hours to welcome art and culture lovers. In December, I left the comfort of my warm couch to venture out for the last &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.firstfridayswinnipeg.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;First Fridays&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; of 2018.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I met up with a friend at 7 pm and started my night with a warm beverage and a snack at the &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;amsterdamtearoom.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Amsterdam Tea Room&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (211 Bannatyne Avenue). Their recently-launched &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;amsterdamtearoom.com&#x2F;dinner-menu&#x2F;&quot;&gt;new menu&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; had popped up in several of my friends’ Instagram stories, and I was eager to try it myself. The last time I’d been there, it was a quaint little tea room; it’s since transformed into a busy, hip tea bar. We grabbed seats at the bar and I ordered a hot toddy and a small plate with crispy fingerling potatoes, charred onion, cucumber, celery, ketchup aioli, mustard seeds, sesame, and pecorino cheese. The server told me that if I took a little bit of all the components of the dish in one big bite, it would taste like a Big Mac—yum!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_2564&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;aligncenter&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;940&amp;quot;]&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-2564 size-large&quot; src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;livingat300main.ca&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2019&#x2F;01&#x2F;IMG_5710-1024x683.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Derek McCandless, Live Music, Amsterdam Tea Room, Exchange District, First Fridays in the Exchange, Downtown Winnipeg&quot; width=&quot;940&quot; height=&quot;627&quot; &#x2F;&gt; Winnipeg Folk Fest performer, Derek McCandless performing at Amsterdam Tea Room on First Fridays in the Exchange on December 7, 2018.

&lt;p&gt;Live music from &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.derrickmccandless.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Derek McCandless&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; gave us a “Folk Fix” to get the evening started while we enjoyed our drinks. The bar was buzzing with people, the chatter blending seamlessly into his soothing voice and guitar notes. We made a game plan and left with our bellies full, ready to take on the night.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our next stop was at &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.graffitigallery.ca&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Graffiti Gallery&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (109 Higgins Avenue) for the opening reception of WOMAN GOOD BAD BAD: a series of all-new work by Winnipeg artist &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gabriellewmfunk.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Gabrielle Funk&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. The gallery floor was deliciously pink, and I fell in love instantly. Abstract pastel graphics on the walls seemed to blend in with the artwork. I later learned that the gallery is modified before every exhibition to match the artwork and create a cohesive experience.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People milled about the gallery with wine glasses and kombucha bottles, bobbing their heads to music from the DJ in the corner. There were free appetizers and a cash bar, and the artwork itself was beautiful. Most of the paintings were based on friends and family members of the artist, and the faces look extremely realistic yet surreal. Through this show, Funk explores the duality of the conventional representation of women in religion, art, and the media.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_2566&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignright&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;500&amp;quot;]&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-2566&quot; src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;livingat300main.ca&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2019&#x2F;01&#x2F;IMG_5741-e1546452983620-683x1024.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tara Davis Studio Boutique, First Fridays in the Exchange, Exchange District, Downtown Winnipeg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;750&quot; &#x2F;&gt; A collection of painting by artist, Joshua Wilson at tara davis studio boutique. Photo credits to the author.[&#x2F;caption]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We moved on to something lighter, heading over to &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.taradavis.ca&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Tara Davis Studio Boutique&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; next. It’s an eclectic and charming boutique at 246 McDermot Avenue, carrying womenswear, art, accessories, and home décor. The exhibit was called “12”—the 7th annual exhibition of 12 local artists showing 12 small works no larger than 12x12”. One of the collections that caught my attention was by Joshua Wilson, an artist who paints quirky pictures of animals with cigarettes. I really wanted to take home a painting of a crab with a cigarette, but I settled for a pair of mismatched purple socks with cacti on them.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My friend and I parted ways, and I walked over to &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.winnipegfilmgroup.com&#x2F;cinematheque&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Cinematheque&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (304-100 Arthur Street) for my last stop of the night: a screening of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;streamingmoviesright.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;movie&#x2F;sorry-to-bother-you&quot;&gt;SORRY TO BOTHER YOU&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, presented by Black Space Winnipeg. I was a little wary of going to this with just my popcorn for company, but in Winnipeg, six degrees of separation is a very real thing. I ran into friends from work and someone I went to school with, so I joined them for the movie.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cinematheque is one of those old-school movie theaters that brings back the romance of movie watching. The architecture of the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;art-space.ca&#x2F;artspace-building&#x2F;&quot;&gt;ArtSpace&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; building is stunning and the theatres are small and intimate. Before heading into the showing, I stopped at the bar for a glass of wine to go with my popcorn.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie started a little late, but no one seemed to mind. Written and directed by Boots Riley and starring &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.imdb.com&#x2F;name&#x2F;nm3147751&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Lakeith Stanfield&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, Sorry to Bother You is a dystopian comedy that addresses societal issues like racism and commercialism. (The ending will leave you feeling unsettled in the best way possible.) It’s both thoughtful and hilarious, with tremendous actors.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was almost midnight by the time the movie ended. Over at &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thetallestpoppy.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;The Tallest Poppy&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (103 Sherbrook Street), &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.synonymartconsultation.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Synonym&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;’s First Friday After Party would be just starting to heat up. But after a full evening of soaking up culture and art, I was ready to head back home.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By midnight, I had only managed to fit in four of the 36 great events happening that night. I hope to go back this week to catch some of the venues I missed. To stay up to date on all the amazing things happening on First Fridays in the Exchange, check out their website &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.firstfridayswinnipeg.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;firstfridayswinnipeg.org&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; a few days before the monthly event.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Have you explored First Fridays yet?&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
