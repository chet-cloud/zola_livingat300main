&lt;p&gt;It is safe to say the spring season is finally here to stay, and after a long winter, Winnipeg is welcoming it warmly! As we transition out of winter and into spring, every Winnipegger knows that with the warm weather comes rain and slush. When it comes to the spring in Winnipeg, the last thing you want to be is unprepared. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;!-- &#x2F;wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it may feel like you have to compromise on staying fashionable to be able to remain dry in this weather like there is no point in even trying to stay on trend in the rain, snow, and slush. Don&#x27;t give up on your style just yet! There are lots of great ways to stay dry and remain in head-to-toe fashion this spring without compromising on your &#x27;outfit of the day&#x27; likes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;!-- &#x2F;wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Put Your Best Foot Forward&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;!-- &#x2F;wp:heading --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to navigating the slushy streets of downtown Winnipeg, having footwear that can trudge through the inevitable slush while still looking fresh is a must for your spring wardrobe. A great pair of waterproof boots or shoes will make all the difference when it comes to beating the weather and still looking great going from outside to inside. You want to make sure that you choose shoes that are made waterproof to avoid damaging a great pair that isn&#x27;t made to withstand the spring conditions. Most pairs of waterproof shoes are made to resist the snow and slush without damaging the fabric, even without a shoe protector, but you still don&#x27;t want to skip out on that.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;!-- &#x2F;wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:image {&quot;id&quot;:7755,&quot;sizeSlug&quot;:&quot;full&quot;,&quot;linkDestination&quot;:&quot;none&quot;} --&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;livingat300main.ca&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2022&#x2F;04&#x2F;pexels-harrison-haines-3070918.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-7755&quot;&#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;!-- &#x2F;wp:image --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:heading {&quot;level&quot;:3} --&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Shoe Protector&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;!-- &#x2F;wp:heading --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter what pair of shoes fits your personal style, make sure you keep them protected from the conditions too. Even though most pairs of waterproof shoes can be worn without a protective spray, no problem, when it comes to the fact that you are going through slush and rain, you do want to do what you can to help keep them in the best condition for as long as possible. Using a protecting spray and cleanser that is made for your shoe material will help them resist wear and tear and prevent the fabric from salt and water damage, keeping them looking fresh year after year.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;!-- &#x2F;wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:heading {&quot;level&quot;:3} --&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Mukluks&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;!-- &#x2F;wp:heading --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mukluks are a popular choice in Winnipeg for very good reason. Not only are the traditional Moccasin made perfect for any of Manitoba&#x27;s conditions, but they also look great and keep you dry and warm in any season. They are great because the rubber sole and waterproof fabrics are made to get you through the worst that mother nature throws at us. I know that I can trust mine to get me from point A to B in the ice and snow or rain and slush without damaging my shoes or my outfit. When it comes to the fur and material of the Mukluks, they are made waterproof to withstand the rain and snow, but you still want to use a protector on these, particularly to keep the fabric and fur in their best condition year after year.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;!-- &#x2F;wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:heading {&quot;level&quot;:3} --&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Blundstones&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;!-- &#x2F;wp:heading --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want something a little more versatile that is great right through from spring to fall, Blundstones and similarly styled shoes are a great option for not only the water and slush, but they are light enough to keep wearing throughout the summer, and it&#x27;s a bonus that they look great with almost anything. These are fashionable leather ankle boots that are not only trending but versatile. These are a great style when you have to wear them inside and out.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;!-- &#x2F;wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:image {&quot;id&quot;:7756,&quot;sizeSlug&quot;:&quot;large&quot;,&quot;linkDestination&quot;:&quot;none&quot;} --&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:heading {&quot;level&quot;:3} --&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Rubber Boots&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;!-- &#x2F;wp:heading --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rubber boots are a cute classic option when you can&#x27;t get out of staying in and safe from the rain. Make it dry from door to door dry through puddles and slush. You can&#x27;t go wrong with a pair of rubber boots in your rainy-day wardrobe. With thousands of cute cuts, styles, and accessories to go with them, you are going to end up wanting to wear your rubber boots this spring.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;!-- &#x2F;wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:heading {&quot;level&quot;:3} --&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Rubber Boot Liners&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;!-- &#x2F;wp:heading --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don&#x27;t have to compromise style for functionality on days when you have to wear your rubber boots. Rubber boot liners are a fashionable addition that goes with any style. Most brands and companies like Hunter have helped make wearing rubber boots from drab to fab. Not only do they add an extra soft liner for your boot, so you don&#x27;t have to walk on rubber, but they look great too.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Cute Classic Coats&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;!-- &#x2F;wp:heading --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every spring wardrobe needs a classic coat to complete it. There are many great different styles to choose from when it comes to finding the perfect coat for getting you through the spring conditions dry and in style.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;!-- &#x2F;wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:image {&quot;id&quot;:7759,&quot;sizeSlug&quot;:&quot;large&quot;,&quot;linkDestination&quot;:&quot;none&quot;} --&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:heading {&quot;level&quot;:3} --&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Long Jackets&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;!-- &#x2F;wp:heading --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long water-resistant jackets are a must-have in any spring wardrobe. It goes without saying that a longer coat is the perfect way to keep your outfit safe from the rain and you on the top of your game. There are many cute styles when it comes to long coats, from zip-up, button-up, and classics like the raincoat or trench coat.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;!-- &#x2F;wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:heading {&quot;level&quot;:3} --&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Trench Coats&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;!-- &#x2F;wp:heading --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trench coats are a timeless classic to keep you and your outfit looking your best. Their waterproof fabric, longer cut, and tie-up waist are a great way to keep your whole outfit dry and heads turning your way.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;!-- &#x2F;wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:image {&quot;id&quot;:7763,&quot;sizeSlug&quot;:&quot;large&quot;,&quot;linkDestination&quot;:&quot;none&quot;} --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Classic Rain Coats&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;!-- &#x2F;wp:heading --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can&#x27;t avoid the rain, embrace it! Raincoats are an adorable and practical way to get through the rain and keep your outfit dry without absorbing water itself. You definitely want to keep one in your closet, along with some of these next accessories for a rainy day.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;!-- &#x2F;wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:heading {&quot;level&quot;:3} --&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hats&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;!-- &#x2F;wp:heading --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another staple of the rainy day wardrobe is, of course, hats! Rain and bucket hats have been making a huge splash with their stylish comeback. Not only are they the missing piece to your rainy-day wardrobe, but they are also one of the staples for staying on trend this season.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;!-- &#x2F;wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:image {&quot;id&quot;:7764,&quot;sizeSlug&quot;:&quot;large&quot;,&quot;linkDestination&quot;:&quot;none&quot;} --&gt;

&lt;!-- &#x2F;wp:image --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:heading {&quot;level&quot;:3} --&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Accessories&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;!-- &#x2F;wp:heading --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to beating the rain and slush this spring, accessories are key! Winnipeg is known for its unpredictable weather, especially in the spring. We literally have to be prepared to go from snow to rain, and back again all within the same week. Having the right accessories on you could make all the difference in how you, and your clothes, handle the ever-changing spring season.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;!-- &#x2F;wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:image {&quot;id&quot;:7765,&quot;sizeSlug&quot;:&quot;full&quot;,&quot;linkDestination&quot;:&quot;none&quot;} --&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;livingat300main.ca&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2022&#x2F;04&#x2F;pexels-castorly-stock-3836252.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-7765&quot;&#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;!-- &#x2F;wp:image --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:heading {&quot;level&quot;:3} --&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Umbrella&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;!-- &#x2F;wp:heading --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The umbrella is something we all think is overrated until it comes time actually to need one. It goes without saying that everyone should have an umbrella on standby in their closet or bag, just in case of unexpected rainfall or drive-by splashes. Anyone who has waited at a bus stop knows exactly what I&#x27;m talking about.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;!-- &#x2F;wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:heading {&quot;level&quot;:3} --&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Pocket Poncho&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;!-- &#x2F;wp:heading --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be prepared for unexpected rainfall with a pocket poncho. These are great to keep in your bag or your car just in case you are caught in the rain, without a jacket or umbrella. They have come a long way from the plastic bag look they used to come in. You can find many fashionable options that you will actually want to wear that you&#x27;ll be glad you have on you when you do have to wear them.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;!-- &#x2F;wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spring is one of the most fashionable times of the year, but it can be hard to stay that way when it is almost one of the messiest times of the year. But with these great pieces in your wardrobe, you will be ready for anything without having to compromise on style. It&#x27;s easy to make the most of the beautiful spring season while navigating through the slushy streets of Winnipeg when your outfit of the day can keep up with our ever-changing conditions as the weather is getting warmer.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<title>Vintage, Modern or Minimalist? Mixing and Matching Your Décor</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Your home is your shelter; where you spend your most intimate time has a part of you. It should tell the world who you are and be where you want to be every evening. No matter how big or small your place is, you can always personalize it to your exact taste by mixing and matching styles!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Fashion is not something that exists in dresses only. Fashion is in the sky, in the street, fashion has to do with ideas, the way we live, what is happening.
—Coco Chanel&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, I love quoting that woman! Interior design trends tend to parallel fashion. The beautiful difference between modern fashion and the styles of the 20s and 70s (years that &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.chanel.com&#x2F;en_CA&#x2F;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chanel&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; marked the most in fashion history) is that now we mix different styles that seem to have nothing in common. Being able to adapt old, mix it with new, and add elements that reflect your true self is living fashionably.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to interior design, mixing and matching styles makes it look like you know what you are doing. If someone tries to guess why everything around your house looks so special—let them guess. The secret is as simple as Scandinavian minimalist: mix it all. Here are 5 things you need to know to get started.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Do your research&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
Perhaps you’re at the threshold, about to refurnish your apartment or just moved into a new place. Either way, the question running through your mind is the same: “How do I make my home nicer, fashionable or just refreshing?”
&lt;p&gt;At this stage, you might already have an idea of how you want your place to look. But in the worst-case scenario, you can’t even imagine; just picking a color for your new couch sounds about as fun as a polar bear dip. Either way, a little research will get your home makeover off to the right start!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you already know what you crave, research will give you fresh ideas and inspiration. It will open up new horizons, help you make decisions, and narrow down your preferences to one or two major styles.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s an example: we all like different things. Ask my husband and I what we think about mid-century nightstands, and you’ll hear a lot of arguments. Mid-century nightstands are the only thing we couldn’t agree on when furnishing our bedroom. In situations like this, doing a bit of research can uncover new ideas, compromises, and inspiration.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suggest &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pinterest.ca&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Pinterest&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (of course!), interior design books—for a general feel—and movies. Inspiration can come from anywhere! We’re all drawn to certain items and materials that reflect our interests, preferences, and dreams. The key to décor that you love is to listen to that voice inside you that reacts immediately during the research phase.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Modern design&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
Modern design is hard to define exactly. It reflects modern art and features the best of minimalism, sophistication, and elegance. Modern interior design is also known for its focus on practicality and usefulness. Every piece in a modern apartment should be useful, rather than artsy and architectural.
&lt;p&gt;Simple lines. Neutral tones. Earthy colors. Open space. That’s the core of modern interior design. This aesthetic has its roots in Scandinavian and German architecture and features more colourful accents than true minimalism does (we’ll get to that later).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_4686&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;aligncenter&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;1024&amp;quot;]&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-4686&quot; src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;livingat300main.ca&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2019&#x2F;05&#x2F;indoor-4148894_1920-1024x683.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Modern Design, Living Room, Home Decor, Winnipeg Apartments, 300 Main Luxury Apartment&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;683&quot; &#x2F;&gt; From tianya1223 on Pixabay[&#x2F;caption]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The open areas, minimalistic and airy aesthetic in modern design has one big disadvantage: It can feel like an office. If you decide to go for a modern look, avoid the strictness and simplicity that is inherent to office space. Focus on details to keep your apartment feeling warm and comfortable. Sentimental photographs of your cat, colourful paintings, wool-textured blankets on the couch, and a few vintage candle holders keep a modern simple space looking cozy and welcoming.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Vintage interior design&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
Romantic, elegant and as cozy as grandma’s house: that’s vintage interior design. Vintage décor creates a feeling of nostalgia through old-fashioned style furniture and lots of texture in pillows, blankets, vases, and paintings. Details like scratches and scrapes on furniture are essential! I suggest visiting your grandparents and asking for that old, scratched-up dresser to make it a statement piece in your bedroom.
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_4688&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;aligncenter&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;600&amp;quot;]&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-4688&quot; src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;livingat300main.ca&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2019&#x2F;05&#x2F;stephanie-harvey-479121-unsplash-237x300.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Vintage Design, Vintage Dresser, Vintage Style, Home Decor, Apartment Decor, Furniture, Winnipeg Apartments, Accent Dresser&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;760&quot; &#x2F;&gt; From Stephanie Harvey of Unsplash.com[&#x2F;caption]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_4689&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;aligncenter&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;600&amp;quot;]&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-4689&quot; src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;livingat300main.ca&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2019&#x2F;05&#x2F;stephanie-harvey-435461-unsplash-225x300.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Vintage Design, Vintage Dresser, Vintage Style, Home Decor, Apartment Decor, Furniture, Winnipeg Apartments, Accent Dresser&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;800&quot; &#x2F;&gt; From Stephanie Harvey of Unsplash.com[&#x2F;caption]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As cozy as vintage can be, it’s important to achieve balance between old and new. It would be easy to go to a flea market and buy a set of furniture, floral wallpaper, a record player, and call it a day; the danger is that your space might end up looking bulky and copied. It might look and feel like living in an old movie. This is where balance comes in: Use antiques and vintage finds as accents.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beside a modern grey couch, place an antique blush pink sofa chair. Instead of floral wallpaper, paint your walls grey or white and hang vintage photographs or oil paintings. Definitely show off your record player and vases, but use them sparingly! No one wants to feel like they live in a museum of a thrift store.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. Minimalist&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
Neutral tones. White. Lots of white. Greenery. Wooden furniture. Wooden details. Nothing extra. Nothing extravagant. Minimalist interior design takes its cues from Scandinavia and had a huge influence on Western countries in the early 90s.
&lt;p&gt;Minimalism is great for making small spaces look bigger thanks to light tones and minimal furniture. Some might call minimalist design boring, but I call it clean and intellectual. It’s like thinking “clean” and getting rid of things that are not necessary—in your life and in your apartment.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_4691&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;aligncenter&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;684&amp;quot;]&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-4691&quot; src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;livingat300main.ca&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2019&#x2F;05&#x2F;alexandra-gorn-493032-unsplash-684x1024.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Minimalist, Minimalism, Scandinavian Design, Home Decor, Apartment Decor, Winnipeg Apartments&quot; width=&quot;684&quot; height=&quot;1024&quot; &#x2F;&gt; by Alexandra Gorn from Unsplash[&#x2F;caption]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think simple lines, linen textures, and light color palettes when decorating your apartment like a minimalist. To void an empty, clinic-like feeling, add unexpected details. A painting by a young, unknown artist? Great choice! It shows off your personality and passion for art. Wooden side table with a funky architectural shape? Go for it, and make it the highlight of the room.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minimalism is all about quality, not quantity, and “less is more” is the rule. Combine sophisticated furniture with clean lines with small, meaningful things—like that quirky painting—to make your place feel special, while still keeping things simple.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. Mixing and matching&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
Mixing-and-matching is its own trend, complete with rules and suggestions for mixing and matching different styles. The first rule that applies in mixing styles is to express yourself boldly, but—there’s always a but—don’t go crazy and overload the space. Choose a theme (like any of the styles above) and stick to that idea to create an overall feel. Then, go and have some fun!
&lt;p&gt;Mix old wooden chairs with colourful metal chairs around the kitchen table. Get brightly-patterned dishes and mix them with minimalistic white dishes. Hang linen curtains and throw plaid wool blankets on the couch. The possibilities are endless!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beauty of mixing and matching is in an artsy composition. First, you create a background; I personally love light grey and white walls. Then, you can start throwing splashes of colours. Select two or three colours that work together, and use them as main accents when getting pillows, paintings and coffee mugs.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My own place is a mix of vintage and minimalist styles. I have piles of old books scattered around, paintings, black-white photographs, and a yellow 50s-style couch. I use simple wooden, grey, or white furniture as a background that I can add color to. Pillows and blankets are my two favourite accents that I can change depending on the season and my mood. While I stick to neutral colours in general, drops of colours are seen in details like bohemian dishware, my blue office chair, and colourful and light wooden photo frames.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furnishing an apartment should feel exciting and fun! You just need some patience to find those special pieces, loving eyes, time, and a will to create an outstanding space around yourself.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;So which side are you on—mixing and matching, or sticking to one style throughout?&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Winnipeggers know the best boutique shopping is on Academy Road or in Osborne Village. But as the gentrification of downtown Winnipeg and the Exchange District gains momentum, more and more small businesses are popping up. Quaintly nestled within the large historic buildings of the downtown area, some of these shops are easy to miss if you don’t know where to look. Those with an eye for fashion might want to keep an eye out for these hidden fashion boutiques downtown and in the Exchange District.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Lennard Taylor&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
246 McDermot Avenue

&lt;p&gt;This clothing store bears the name of its young designer. A boutique fashion house that designs and produces its own high-quality clothing for women, there is even opportunity at the back of the store for interested shoppers to watch how the clothing is produced. The style is both classic and modern at the same time; comfortable business wear or elevated casual wear. Lennard Taylor invites custom work and offers pieces of original art for sale.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Livestock Winnipeg&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
407 Graham Avenue
Since 2017
&lt;p&gt;On my first attempt to check out this shop, I completely missed it and kept walking. That’s a tribute to how hidden it is. This store is located at 407 Graham Avenue and is the thirds of its chain to open in Canada, following a store in Vancouver and another in Toronto. Livestock specializes in sneakers and modern streetwear. It’s unquestionably a top stop for the sneakerhead, or for anyone on a serious hunt for a pair of fashionable sneakers. Livestock Winnipeg carries men’s&#x2F;unisex clothing in-store and a smaller selection of women’s clothing online.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
