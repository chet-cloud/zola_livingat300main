		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Your home is your shelter; where you spend your most intimate time has a part of you. It should tell the world who you are and be where you want to be every evening. No matter how big or small your place is, you can always personalize it to your exact taste by mixing and matching styles!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Fashion is not something that exists in dresses only. Fashion is in the sky, in the street, fashion has to do with ideas, the way we live, what is happening.

&lt;p&gt;Oh, I love quoting that woman! Interior design trends tend to parallel fashion. The beautiful difference between modern fashion and the styles of the 20s and 70s (years that &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.chanel.com&#x2F;en_CA&#x2F;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chanel&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; marked the most in fashion history) is that now we mix different styles that seem to have nothing in common. Being able to adapt old, mix it with new, and add elements that reflect your true self is living fashionably.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to interior design, mixing and matching styles makes it look like you know what you are doing. If someone tries to guess why everything around your house looks so special—let them guess. The secret is as simple as Scandinavian minimalist: mix it all. Here are 5 things you need to know to get started.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Do your research&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
Perhaps you’re at the threshold, about to refurnish your apartment or just moved into a new place. Either way, the question running through your mind is the same: “How do I make my home nicer, fashionable or just refreshing?”
&lt;p&gt;At this stage, you might already have an idea of how you want your place to look. But in the worst-case scenario, you can’t even imagine; just picking a color for your new couch sounds about as fun as a polar bear dip. Either way, a little research will get your home makeover off to the right start!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you already know what you crave, research will give you fresh ideas and inspiration. It will open up new horizons, help you make decisions, and narrow down your preferences to one or two major styles.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s an example: we all like different things. Ask my husband and I what we think about mid-century nightstands, and you’ll hear a lot of arguments. Mid-century nightstands are the only thing we couldn’t agree on when furnishing our bedroom. In situations like this, doing a bit of research can uncover new ideas, compromises, and inspiration.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suggest &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pinterest.ca&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Pinterest&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (of course!), interior design books—for a general feel—and movies. Inspiration can come from anywhere! We’re all drawn to certain items and materials that reflect our interests, preferences, and dreams. The key to décor that you love is to listen to that voice inside you that reacts immediately during the research phase.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Modern design&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
Modern design is hard to define exactly. It reflects modern art and features the best of minimalism, sophistication, and elegance. Modern interior design is also known for its focus on practicality and usefulness. Every piece in a modern apartment should be useful, rather than artsy and architectural.
&lt;p&gt;Simple lines. Neutral tones. Earthy colors. Open space. That’s the core of modern interior design. This aesthetic has its roots in Scandinavian and German architecture and features more colourful accents than true minimalism does (we’ll get to that later).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_4686&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;aligncenter&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;1024&amp;quot;]&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-4686&quot; src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;livingat300main.ca&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2019&#x2F;05&#x2F;indoor-4148894_1920-1024x683.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Modern Design, Living Room, Home Decor, Winnipeg Apartments, 300 Main Luxury Apartment&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;683&quot; &#x2F;&gt; From tianya1223 on Pixabay[&#x2F;caption]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The open areas, minimalistic and airy aesthetic in modern design has one big disadvantage: It can feel like an office. If you decide to go for a modern look, avoid the strictness and simplicity that is inherent to office space. Focus on details to keep your apartment feeling warm and comfortable. Sentimental photographs of your cat, colourful paintings, wool-textured blankets on the couch, and a few vintage candle holders keep a modern simple space looking cozy and welcoming.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Vintage interior design&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
Romantic, elegant and as cozy as grandma’s house: that’s vintage interior design. Vintage décor creates a feeling of nostalgia through old-fashioned style furniture and lots of texture in pillows, blankets, vases, and paintings. Details like scratches and scrapes on furniture are essential! I suggest visiting your grandparents and asking for that old, scratched-up dresser to make it a statement piece in your bedroom.
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_4688&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;aligncenter&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;600&amp;quot;]&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-4688&quot; src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;livingat300main.ca&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2019&#x2F;05&#x2F;stephanie-harvey-479121-unsplash-237x300.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Vintage Design, Vintage Dresser, Vintage Style, Home Decor, Apartment Decor, Furniture, Winnipeg Apartments, Accent Dresser&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;760&quot; &#x2F;&gt; From Stephanie Harvey of Unsplash.com[&#x2F;caption]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_4689&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;aligncenter&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;600&amp;quot;]&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-4689&quot; src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;livingat300main.ca&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2019&#x2F;05&#x2F;stephanie-harvey-435461-unsplash-225x300.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Vintage Design, Vintage Dresser, Vintage Style, Home Decor, Apartment Decor, Furniture, Winnipeg Apartments, Accent Dresser&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;800&quot; &#x2F;&gt; From Stephanie Harvey of Unsplash.com[&#x2F;caption]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As cozy as vintage can be, it’s important to achieve balance between old and new. It would be easy to go to a flea market and buy a set of furniture, floral wallpaper, a record player, and call it a day; the danger is that your space might end up looking bulky and copied. It might look and feel like living in an old movie. This is where balance comes in: Use antiques and vintage finds as accents.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beside a modern grey couch, place an antique blush pink sofa chair. Instead of floral wallpaper, paint your walls grey or white and hang vintage photographs or oil paintings. Definitely show off your record player and vases, but use them sparingly! No one wants to feel like they live in a museum of a thrift store.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. Minimalist&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
Neutral tones. White. Lots of white. Greenery. Wooden furniture. Wooden details. Nothing extra. Nothing extravagant. Minimalist interior design takes its cues from Scandinavia and had a huge influence on Western countries in the early 90s.
&lt;p&gt;Minimalism is great for making small spaces look bigger thanks to light tones and minimal furniture. Some might call minimalist design boring, but I call it clean and intellectual. It’s like thinking “clean” and getting rid of things that are not necessary—in your life and in your apartment.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_4691&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;aligncenter&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;684&amp;quot;]&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-4691&quot; src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;livingat300main.ca&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2019&#x2F;05&#x2F;alexandra-gorn-493032-unsplash-684x1024.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Minimalist, Minimalism, Scandinavian Design, Home Decor, Apartment Decor, Winnipeg Apartments&quot; width=&quot;684&quot; height=&quot;1024&quot; &#x2F;&gt; by Alexandra Gorn from Unsplash[&#x2F;caption]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think simple lines, linen textures, and light color palettes when decorating your apartment like a minimalist. To void an empty, clinic-like feeling, add unexpected details. A painting by a young, unknown artist? Great choice! It shows off your personality and passion for art. Wooden side table with a funky architectural shape? Go for it, and make it the highlight of the room.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minimalism is all about quality, not quantity, and “less is more” is the rule. Combine sophisticated furniture with clean lines with small, meaningful things—like that quirky painting—to make your place feel special, while still keeping things simple.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. Mixing and matching&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
Mixing-and-matching is its own trend, complete with rules and suggestions for mixing and matching different styles. The first rule that applies in mixing styles is to express yourself boldly, but—there’s always a but—don’t go crazy and overload the space. Choose a theme (like any of the styles above) and stick to that idea to create an overall feel. Then, go and have some fun!
&lt;p&gt;Mix old wooden chairs with colourful metal chairs around the kitchen table. Get brightly-patterned dishes and mix them with minimalistic white dishes. Hang linen curtains and throw plaid wool blankets on the couch. The possibilities are endless!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beauty of mixing and matching is in an artsy composition. First, you create a background; I personally love light grey and white walls. Then, you can start throwing splashes of colours. Select two or three colours that work together, and use them as main accents when getting pillows, paintings and coffee mugs.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My own place is a mix of vintage and minimalist styles. I have piles of old books scattered around, paintings, black-white photographs, and a yellow 50s-style couch. I use simple wooden, grey, or white furniture as a background that I can add color to. Pillows and blankets are my two favourite accents that I can change depending on the season and my mood. While I stick to neutral colours in general, drops of colours are seen in details like bohemian dishware, my blue office chair, and colourful and light wooden photo frames.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furnishing an apartment should feel exciting and fun! You just need some patience to find those special pieces, loving eyes, time, and a will to create an outstanding space around yourself.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;So which side are you on—mixing and matching, or sticking to one style throughout?&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After spending two years studying, working, and falling in love in Scotland, in October I moved into a one-bedroom suite in the &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theboyceloftsonross.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Boyce Lofts&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; in the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;exchangedistrict.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Exchange District&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. It was the first time I didn’t have to live with roommates, and the first time I didn’t have to move into a furnished apartment. The Boyce Lofts were brand new and no one had lived in the space before me. It was a blank canvas (and not just because of the white walls and white cabinetry), and I was so excited to decorate and furnish it just the way I wanted.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But while my apartment has high ceilings and an open concept, it’s pretty small—at around 500 square feet—and narrow enough that I can’t fit furniture on both sides of the living&#x2F;dining room. So not only did I have to plan out the use of space, but I had to make sure I wasn’t filling the space with too much. I knew my already-small space would feel even smaller with clutter and large furniture. I had to be smart about decorating.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m no design expert, but I like to think I have good taste, and I strongly believe that minimalism is the way forward. Not only does minimalism help reduce consumerism, but it helps you &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.psychologytoday.com&#x2F;ca&#x2F;blog&#x2F;anxiety-zen&#x2F;201612&#x2F;minimalism-when-living-less-means-more-mental-health&quot;&gt;feel&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; unburdened in the place that should matter most—home. So here are some tips on designing your small space.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Storage&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
When you have less space to leave things lying around, you can’t afford to have much clutter! Even if you’re not a messy person, it’s hard to keep things clean and tidy if you simply have too much stuff. It’s easy to accumulate Christmas and birthday gifts you didn’t really want, impulse buys you could’ve done without, and clothing and shoes.
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, I understand that sometimes you just don’t want to be looking at your things, especially if it’s miscellaneous stuff you’re unsure where to store. Small-space living is your chance to get creative!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you move into your small space, purge your belongings. Donate or sell them things you don’t want or need (&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.siloam.ca&#x2F;donate&#x2F;donate&#x2F;?utm_source=google&amp;amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;amp;utm_term=siloam%20mission&amp;amp;utm_campaign=paid&amp;amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAqt7jBRAcEiwAof2uK9QVeCxi4pU-My2leJVWHSvKIY9wy_26stHto4zZ_d46JGC9wNY6qBoCMXwQAvD_BwE&quot;&gt;Siloam Mission&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; gratefully accepts new and gently used clothing!). Not only will you feel unburdened from all these nonessential objects, but your small space will feel bigger and you’ll have more room to work with.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For storing your belongings, opt for open shelving. Closed shelving gives the illusion that your walls are closing in and that the room is even smaller. I have an abundance of kitchen cabinet space, so I use it to store some non-kitchen related items as well.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the bed is a great place to store items you don’t use very often. You can buy long, slim boxes exactly for this purpose, or you can even get a storage bed that has built-in storage under the mattress.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your building has storage lockers, use yours! They’re handy for storing larger items like suitcases, bicycles, and seasonal clothing. Items that are essential, but seasonal, and too clunky to be keeping in your apartment year-long.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Furniture&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
When &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;hutk.ca&#x2F;&quot;&gt;choosing furniture&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for your small space, look for pieces that are light and don’t take up a lot of space, or that give the illusion that they don’t. Avoid big, clunky, overstuffed furniture, and choose pieces that are low to the ground and have exposed legs.
&lt;p&gt;Go for &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.interiorillusions.ca&#x2F;product-category&#x2F;furniture&#x2F;living-room&#x2F;accent-chairs&#x2F;&quot;&gt;sleek armless chairs&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and try transparent coffee tables, which won’t look like they’re taking any room at all. Think about using two small coffee tables instead of one big one that takes up a lot of space.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_3430&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;aligncenter&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;940&amp;quot;]&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-3430&quot; src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;livingat300main.ca&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2019&#x2F;03&#x2F;by-interior_illusions-1024x1024.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Interior Illusions, Interior Design, Small Space, Downtown Apartments, 300 Main Downtown Winnipeg Apartments&quot; width=&quot;940&quot; height=&quot;940&quot; &#x2F;&gt; by @interior_illusions on Instagram[&#x2F;caption]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dual or multipurpose pieces are key in a small space. Consider getting an ottoman instead of a coffee table so it can do double duty as extra seating. (Bonus points if it has built-in storage!) Floor cushions also make great emergency seating for when you have guests over, and you can stack them up when you’re not using them.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look into getting an expandable or folding dining table. Keep it small when you’re alone and open it up to fit all your friends around the table the next time you’re hosting brunch.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For storing things like books and &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;intothemusic.ca&#x2F;&quot;&gt;records&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, opt for a shelving unit that is vertical, not horizontal. You’ll be able to store more items while taking up less floor space. If you can, install floating shelves to avoid using up precious square footage. They’re sleek, easy to set up, and you can arrange them however you like.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A TV media console can take up a lot of space, so mount your television on the wall to minimize the use of floor space. I took it a step further and got a projector—they’re cheaper, much smaller, easily transportable, and a great alternative to a clunky television if you have white walls.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Decoration&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
Plants are the easiest way to decorate and brighten up your space. If you have a history of being bad at keeping plants alive (guilty as charged!), try a cactus or a bonsai; they’re small, cute, and can withstand being over or under watered. Stop by &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;verdeplantdesign.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Verde Plant Design&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for a great selection!
&lt;p&gt;Don’t be afraid to decorate your walls with &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wag.ca&#x2F;visit&#x2F;shop&quot;&gt;art&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; that you love. Mirrors make a space look larger, so go on the hunt for a mirror with a stylish frame. A stylish mirror can function as part of your decor, not just something you check to make sure you look good before heading out the door.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hang your curtains from the ceiling, not at the top of the window frame—it’ll create the illusion of higher ceilings and a larger space.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to creating a colour palette for a small space, use colour sparingly. Use light colours for your walls and furniture, and dark or bold colours as accents only, such as throw pillows, vases, or lamps. Try to create a colour palette that uses only two to three colours.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Getting Started&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
Where do you spend the most time? Focus your spending on that area to get the most out of your budget. If you like sleeping, invest in a bed you can’t wait to crawl into; if you like watching TV, invest in a cozy sofa; if you work from home, invest in a good working space, with a comfy chair and a nice desk. Make a plan, and don’t buy everything at once. Get the important things like your bed and your sofa first, live with it for a bit, and feel out what you need to get next; you might surprise yourself!
