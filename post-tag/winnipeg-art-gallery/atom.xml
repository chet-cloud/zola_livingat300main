		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After spending two years studying, working, and falling in love in Scotland, in October I moved into a one-bedroom suite in the &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theboyceloftsonross.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Boyce Lofts&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; in the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;exchangedistrict.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Exchange District&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. It was the first time I didn’t have to live with roommates, and the first time I didn’t have to move into a furnished apartment. The Boyce Lofts were brand new and no one had lived in the space before me. It was a blank canvas (and not just because of the white walls and white cabinetry), and I was so excited to decorate and furnish it just the way I wanted.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But while my apartment has high ceilings and an open concept, it’s pretty small—at around 500 square feet—and narrow enough that I can’t fit furniture on both sides of the living&#x2F;dining room. So not only did I have to plan out the use of space, but I had to make sure I wasn’t filling the space with too much. I knew my already-small space would feel even smaller with clutter and large furniture. I had to be smart about decorating.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m no design expert, but I like to think I have good taste, and I strongly believe that minimalism is the way forward. Not only does minimalism help reduce consumerism, but it helps you &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.psychologytoday.com&#x2F;ca&#x2F;blog&#x2F;anxiety-zen&#x2F;201612&#x2F;minimalism-when-living-less-means-more-mental-health&quot;&gt;feel&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; unburdened in the place that should matter most—home. So here are some tips on designing your small space.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Storage&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
When you have less space to leave things lying around, you can’t afford to have much clutter! Even if you’re not a messy person, it’s hard to keep things clean and tidy if you simply have too much stuff. It’s easy to accumulate Christmas and birthday gifts you didn’t really want, impulse buys you could’ve done without, and clothing and shoes.
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, I understand that sometimes you just don’t want to be looking at your things, especially if it’s miscellaneous stuff you’re unsure where to store. Small-space living is your chance to get creative!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you move into your small space, purge your belongings. Donate or sell them things you don’t want or need (&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.siloam.ca&#x2F;donate&#x2F;donate&#x2F;?utm_source=google&amp;amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;amp;utm_term=siloam%20mission&amp;amp;utm_campaign=paid&amp;amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAqt7jBRAcEiwAof2uK9QVeCxi4pU-My2leJVWHSvKIY9wy_26stHto4zZ_d46JGC9wNY6qBoCMXwQAvD_BwE&quot;&gt;Siloam Mission&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; gratefully accepts new and gently used clothing!). Not only will you feel unburdened from all these nonessential objects, but your small space will feel bigger and you’ll have more room to work with.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For storing your belongings, opt for open shelving. Closed shelving gives the illusion that your walls are closing in and that the room is even smaller. I have an abundance of kitchen cabinet space, so I use it to store some non-kitchen related items as well.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the bed is a great place to store items you don’t use very often. You can buy long, slim boxes exactly for this purpose, or you can even get a storage bed that has built-in storage under the mattress.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your building has storage lockers, use yours! They’re handy for storing larger items like suitcases, bicycles, and seasonal clothing. Items that are essential, but seasonal, and too clunky to be keeping in your apartment year-long.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Furniture&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
When &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;hutk.ca&#x2F;&quot;&gt;choosing furniture&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for your small space, look for pieces that are light and don’t take up a lot of space, or that give the illusion that they don’t. Avoid big, clunky, overstuffed furniture, and choose pieces that are low to the ground and have exposed legs.
&lt;p&gt;Go for &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.interiorillusions.ca&#x2F;product-category&#x2F;furniture&#x2F;living-room&#x2F;accent-chairs&#x2F;&quot;&gt;sleek armless chairs&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and try transparent coffee tables, which won’t look like they’re taking any room at all. Think about using two small coffee tables instead of one big one that takes up a lot of space.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_3430&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;aligncenter&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;940&amp;quot;]&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-3430&quot; src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;livingat300main.ca&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2019&#x2F;03&#x2F;by-interior_illusions-1024x1024.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Interior Illusions, Interior Design, Small Space, Downtown Apartments, 300 Main Downtown Winnipeg Apartments&quot; width=&quot;940&quot; height=&quot;940&quot; &#x2F;&gt; by @interior_illusions on Instagram[&#x2F;caption]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dual or multipurpose pieces are key in a small space. Consider getting an ottoman instead of a coffee table so it can do double duty as extra seating. (Bonus points if it has built-in storage!) Floor cushions also make great emergency seating for when you have guests over, and you can stack them up when you’re not using them.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look into getting an expandable or folding dining table. Keep it small when you’re alone and open it up to fit all your friends around the table the next time you’re hosting brunch.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For storing things like books and &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;intothemusic.ca&#x2F;&quot;&gt;records&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, opt for a shelving unit that is vertical, not horizontal. You’ll be able to store more items while taking up less floor space. If you can, install floating shelves to avoid using up precious square footage. They’re sleek, easy to set up, and you can arrange them however you like.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A TV media console can take up a lot of space, so mount your television on the wall to minimize the use of floor space. I took it a step further and got a projector—they’re cheaper, much smaller, easily transportable, and a great alternative to a clunky television if you have white walls.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Decoration&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
Plants are the easiest way to decorate and brighten up your space. If you have a history of being bad at keeping plants alive (guilty as charged!), try a cactus or a bonsai; they’re small, cute, and can withstand being over or under watered. Stop by &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;verdeplantdesign.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Verde Plant Design&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for a great selection!
&lt;p&gt;Don’t be afraid to decorate your walls with &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wag.ca&#x2F;visit&#x2F;shop&quot;&gt;art&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; that you love. Mirrors make a space look larger, so go on the hunt for a mirror with a stylish frame. A stylish mirror can function as part of your decor, not just something you check to make sure you look good before heading out the door.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hang your curtains from the ceiling, not at the top of the window frame—it’ll create the illusion of higher ceilings and a larger space.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to creating a colour palette for a small space, use colour sparingly. Use light colours for your walls and furniture, and dark or bold colours as accents only, such as throw pillows, vases, or lamps. Try to create a colour palette that uses only two to three colours.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Getting Started&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
Where do you spend the most time? Focus your spending on that area to get the most out of your budget. If you like sleeping, invest in a bed you can’t wait to crawl into; if you like watching TV, invest in a cozy sofa; if you work from home, invest in a good working space, with a comfy chair and a nice desk. Make a plan, and don’t buy everything at once. Get the important things like your bed and your sofa first, live with it for a bit, and feel out what you need to get next; you might surprise yourself!

		<title>Winnipeg Presented in a New Light: Photographers Capturing the Beauty of Downtown Winnipeg</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_256&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignleft&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;400&amp;quot;]&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.instagram.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;BnfSFpQAbUh&#x2F;&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-256&quot; src=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;livingat300main.ca&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2018&#x2F;10&#x2F;by-Josh-Lavallee-819x1024.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; Photo by Josh Lavallee @yoshigrams[&#x2F;caption]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s 5:30 am on a brisk Saturday morning in Winnipeg. Josh, better known amongst his peers as “@yoshigrams”, is dangling his feet from a rooftop in the historic Exchange District awaiting the first signs of light. His mission on this crisp September morning is to capture the first beams of sunlight as they rise to cascade over the array of brick buildings set in Chicago style. The aged brick buildings proudly display the remnants of hand painted ads and signs from years past. These ghosted-signed walls will serve as today’s backdrop. Sitting outside in the brisk weather patiently waiting for the sun’s first light is a small price to pay for the stunning photo he will capture today through the lense of his trusty and well-loved camera.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{}&quot;&gt; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Josh is not alone in his mission to capture the city’s downtown core and the people calling it home. This group of talented and creative Winnipeg photographers, whether they know it or not, is quickly changing the way in which we view our city of just over 700,000 residents. &lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{}&quot;&gt; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{}&quot;&gt; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many, downtown Winnipeg has become a focal point and hub for photography thanks in part to its diverse cityscapes and character. A mix of late 1800s Chicago-style architecture that inhabits the Exchange, along with sporadic growth and revitalization in the downtown core, have all played a part in this resurgence of interest. New projects and spaces like &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.truenorthsquare.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;True North Square&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;humanrights.ca&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Museum of Human Rights&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and the renovation of the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wcc.mb.ca&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Winnipeg Convention Centre&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; have captured the imagination of many–tourists and Winnipeggers alike. This diverse area encompasses approximately 179.18 square miles and is enjoyably explored on foot or bicycle. One can cover a large portion of the downtown area in a 15-minute bike ride or 20-minute walk from Portage and Main; that is all the distance separating the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theforks.com&#x2F;eat-and-drink&#x2F;dine&#x2F;the-common&quot;&gt;Commons at the Forks Market&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; from the steps of the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gov.mb.ca&#x2F;legislature&#x2F;visiting&#x2F;index.html&quot;&gt;Manitoba Legislative Building&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; or the heart of the Exchange and Provencher Bridge.&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{}&quot;&gt; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_251&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignnone&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;940&amp;quot;]&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-251 size-large&quot; src=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;livingat300main.ca&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2018&#x2F;10&#x2F;Provencher-1024x576.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;940&quot; height=&quot;529&quot; &#x2F;&gt; Photo by Joe Lu[&#x2F;caption]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{}&quot;&gt; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To what do we attribute this influx and growth of interest in photography? We could sit around and debate the influence of good-quality and accessible entry-level camera gear, the evolution of the cell phone camera, or the popularity of photo sharing apps like Instagram and VSCO. While these all come into play, I think there’s something bigger and deeper at the heart of it all. I see a vast number of up-and-coming photographers with a yearning for adventure who are finding it all in their own backyard: Downtown Winnipeg.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{}&quot;&gt; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_264&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignright&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;450&amp;quot;]&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.instagram.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;BkDJcrRh9sw&#x2F;&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-264&quot; src=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;livingat300main.ca&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2018&#x2F;10&#x2F;by-Mike-Peters-1024x1024.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; Photo by Mike Peters @93mp[&#x2F;caption]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This growing talent pool have proven their ability to capture the same city and locations in contrasting and unique shooting and editing styles. I can’t help but think that this friendly competition is the reason we are seeing such imagery evolving. While some may choose to shoot strictly on iPhones and others prefer investing in higher-end DSLRs, the well of creativity does not run dry. From romanticized skylines to whimsical street views. the variety of ways we can view our city has never been as interesting, as beautiful, or as diverse. This wave of both established and up-and-coming artists are transforming the mundane streets and views into beautiful works of art, ready to be hung on gallery and condo walls alike. &lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{}&quot;&gt; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{}&quot;&gt; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it is not just the aesthetic quality these photos possess, but the way in which they engage the viewer. Sometimes a familiar space is seen in a new light or a recommendation unintentional is offered. Leveraging tools like social media have forged new paths for us to journey along with photographers as they explore the downtown. Thanks to apps like VSCO and Instagram, we find ourselves consistently screenshotting images taken by some of our favourite Winnipeg photographers. It might be a simple reminder to order a print or, even more often, a reminder to add a specific location to our “To Do and See” list.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{}&quot;&gt; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my phone amongst the clutter is an album labelled “To Do and See.” I enjoy photography, though I am far from accomplished; perhaps even labelling it a “hobby” is a statement of generosity.  But in the interests of inspiring other local, amateur photographers to grab their camera of choice and hit the pavement for adventure, I took a minute to map out one of my recent excursions.&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{}&quot;&gt; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{}&quot;&gt; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_280&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignleft&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;500&amp;quot;]&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.instagram.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;BRHsmeHAepw&#x2F;&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-280&quot; src=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;livingat300main.ca&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2018&#x2F;10&#x2F;by-Manny-Berkal-Sarbit-820x1024.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;625&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; Photo by Manny Berkal-Sarbit @leggrease[&#x2F;caption]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the steps of 300 Main, camera in tow, I hang a right and walk the 7 minutes to Via Rail Union Station to marvel at the building interior. I have been here before, but years ago when I did not have the appreciation I do now. Not many people know that the Historic Building built in 1908 through 1909 was designed by Warren and Wetmore, architects of New York’s Grand Central Station.  A few years back, an image of this space captured by Josh helped me to appreciate the intricate workings of the inner dome-shaped ceiling. &lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{}&quot;&gt; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{}&quot;&gt; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I keep moving. Depending on the time of year and day, it looks like I am heading west to grab a couple of photos at Upper Fort Garry Park. I have driven by on a weekly basis for many years, yet I desire to take it in first-hand.  It’s hard to believe that more than 400 feet of steel and light went into the installation that scribe three continuous lines tracing the history of western Canada and of &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.upperfortgarry.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Upper Fort Garry&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. &lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{}&quot;&gt; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{}&quot;&gt; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time for some refreshment. I am sitting down for a drink at the Sky Lounge behind Hotel Fort Garry. Sky Lounge offers a stunning skyline view overlooking downtown and the Forks and is located just a few floors from Prairie 360, with views of the city in its entirety. If the day was still young I may rather have opted to grab a coffee at &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.foolsandhorses.ca&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Fools + Horses&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; en route to lunch, served up on Broadway courtesy of the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theredember.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Red Ember Food&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; truck just a block west from &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.foolsandhorses.ca&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Fools + Horses&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.  &lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{}&quot;&gt; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{}&quot;&gt; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point I have a few options. Option one, I can cross the street and do a self-guided tour of the Manitoba Legislative Building, hoping to adequately capture the extensive masonry work and do my best to make out the Hermetic Code written in stone (literally). Option two, I can walk up a block to hit the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wag.ca&#x2F;&quot;&gt;WAG&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;’s rooftop terrace or walk to the top of The Bay parkade across the street. These are some of the greatest vantage points of downtown and all it has to offer. Option three, I can venture North and check out the newly renovated Winnipeg Convention Centre (which has some awesome exterior textures and lighting) before sitting down in True North Square to do some skyward shooting. &lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{}&quot;&gt; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{}&quot;&gt; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter which of these options I choose, I am then heading Northeast to continue the journey in the Exchange District. There I will capture some street scenes reminiscent of Chicago, some ghost signs that decorate the building landscape, and then stop for a bite at either &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kingandbannatyne.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;King + Bannatyne&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.deerandalmond.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Deer + Almond&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; before seeing who or what I can capture at the the Cube Stage in Old Market Square. &lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{}&quot;&gt; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{}&quot;&gt; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_267&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignright&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;500&amp;quot;]&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.instagram.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;Bj2RcGZnbR9&#x2F;&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-267&quot; src=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;livingat300main.ca&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2018&#x2F;10&#x2F;by-Mike-Peters-2-819x1024.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;625&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; Photo by Mike Peters @93mp[&#x2F;caption]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My last route will be Waterfront Drive, making my way Southeast to capture &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;goldeyes.com&#x2F;shaw-park&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Shaw Park&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; with the arches of Provencher Street Bridge in the background. My final stop will be the ever-popular Museum of Human Rights. All said and done, I will have covered a good portion of downtown Winnipeg–Broadway–Assiniboine, South Portage, the Exchange District, Waterfront and the Forks. I will leave Central Park and Chinatown for my next adventure. All these places and spaces appeared on my timeline at some point; and it was either the lighting or composition that caught my attention in a way I had not viewed before.&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{}&quot;&gt; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{}&quot;&gt; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Winnipeg’s downtown continues its renaissance, city dwellers and tourists alike are rediscovering all it has to offer. A vibrant city requires an active heart; a central core. Winnipeg has always possessed this active heart, yet at some points in time the vital signs have been seemingly weak. When the city of Winnipeg refocused its vision back to making a beautiful and accessible downtown, Winnipeggers took note.
